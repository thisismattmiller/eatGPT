My project is simple to describe. It is a piece of music, Variation VII, indeter­minate in form and detail, making use of the sound sys­tem which has been devised collectively for this festival, further making use of modu­lation means organized by David Tudor, using as sound sources only those sounds which are in the air at the moment of performance, picked up via the communi­cation bands, telephone lines, microphones, together with, instead of musical in­struments, a variety of household appliances and frequency generators.
The technical problems involved in any single project tend to reduce the impact of the original idea, but in being solved they produce a situation different than anyone could have pre-imagined.",248

ln my piece, I approach the new technology on several levels. Chemicals developed by the new technology permit me to use elements formoerly not possible-an object gradually chang­ing color, ""snow bubbles"" rising from the ground, people enveloped by ""clouds."" By utilizing our internal broadcasting system, I can have pillows sing out while they are bounced on the floor or thrown in the air. By utilizing our remote control system, I can have an actor pursued by an air­ borne object or direct the same object to approach floating targets.
On another level, my piece deals with machine-like qual­ities in people: robot-like people capable of memorizing enormous amounts of data or of making multi-digit calculations in their heads (as found in psychiatric literature): the risk of putting ""robots"" (narrow minds) in situations for which they are not ""programmed"" - i.e., crisis situations - and machines getting out of control. Juxtaposed with this are glimpses of everyday events and characters of the world of today. Bob Hope and Mao Tse Tung appear in New York city street demonstrations, for example. For this we will use films of an actual demonstration along with tapes of the reactions of the people who see it. Tape and film become a part of the piece. New York, China, Indonesia, the bottom of the sea, space, the world of the future (as seen in a science fiction movie) all are interwoven in­ to a triptych of slide, movie, and television screens. There's no explanation. The spectator  draws conclusions or not, as he chooses.
l think of it as initiation rites for a new medium. Total Theater.

This piece is a dance with a set. It is cast not only by those chosen as permanent population (for the duration of the piece) but by those who have chosen to come to see it, and it is presumed that they will observe each other. With regards to air pressure and topography this piece is not an airplane, is pretty much the opposite of an airplane, but much of the rest of it is analogous.

A work built around three elements divided into parts equal in time.
Three elements:
1. Internal sound poten­tials of the body
2. External body color
3. A singular work activity
The body sounds, example:
brain waves, muscle move­ment, eye movement, will be picked up by differential am­plifiers and transmitted to the central control stations to be distributed by the sound person.
All properties and dress will have the color identity of the skin of the performers.
The work activity is the random placement of 100 numbered six foot squares of duck in a ten by ten modular pattern and then retrieved in a correct arithmetic progres­sion and placed centrally. The placement  and retrieving of the squares will be a designation of the two parts.

vehicle

cast: William Davis Alex Hay
slides by: Les Levine
Vehicle consists of ma­terials animate, inanimate, air-supported	(in one in­ tance), which can exist in a non-static state and be ob­served in increased dimen­sion as they come in contact with light and sound sources made available consistently or intermittedly	by radio signals through-out	the dance.
The   Doppler sonar has ultrasonic beam sources and a receiver. The beam emits frequencies at a level which is greater than our hearing capacity. A moving figure or object passing in front of the beam interrupts it and sends frequencies back to the re­ceiver of the sonar at a level determined by the velocity of the figure or object. What we hear is the proportional difference between the fre­quencies sent out and those returned through interrup­tion of the beam, and the re­sulting reduction in the fre­quency level is what makes the sonar audible. Middle C (as we know it in music) is supposed to occur at approx­imately three feet per second of  movement.   This device, however, picks up movement of any duration or speed at the exact time that it begins or ends.
The ground effect ma­chine is made from a General Motors refrigerator part which is designed as a plat­ form to raise the 440 lb. weight of a refrigerator a fraction of an inch off the ground by the intake of air from a vacuum cleaner, thus making it possible to move the 440 lbs. with ease. The engineer, Per Biorn, installed two vacuum cleaner motors onto this platform so that I am in effect on a cushion of air when I use it.
I intend to utilize these de­ vices in a set of circum­stances as  instruments which may or may not be efficient to the notion of com­pleting anything. I do not feel that dance should be limited to the display of physical ex­ertion alone; anything that can exist in a non-static state for a certain duration of time is of interest to me. My ideas are generally derived from the laws which govern the materials themselves and I attempt to allow the qualities and limitations of materials to be exposed in different situations.

I am after a work around the stability of a film image and the immediacy of news­ flash. The images are con­cerns - the whole piece makes an image. Television is a great way to collect stuff; besides what's on the air, a camera on anything brings it in live- a local newsflash. Film is a rock solid steady unchangeable record of someone looking at some­ thing past.

Bandoneon !, (bandoneon the production of visual factorial), is a combine incoporating programmed audio circuits, moving loudspeakers, tv images and lighting, instrumentally excited.
The instrument, a bandoneon, will create signals whic are simultaneously used as material for differentiated audio spectrums (achieved through modulation means, and special loudspeaker construction), for the production of visual images, devised by Lowell Cross; for the activation of programming devices controlling the audio visual environment, devised by Bob Kieronski (""Vochrome,"" and programmed patchboard) and Fred Waldhauer (Proportional Control).

Bandoneon ! uses no composing means; when activated it composes itself out of its own composite instrumental nature.

Solo is a white, even, clear event in space.The perform­ ers are part of the space and light. They continue the quality of the area - a white environment. All movement is with the intention of main­taining a balance of order and evenness.
S010 is cumulative, gradu­ally accumulating more light, more platforms, more per­formers, more activity -yet remaining as still and com­posed as in the beginning.
There are 24 performers. Eight of the performers re­main stationary. Formally dressed, they are seated as a musical ensemble. From this position they operate eight remote control plat­ forms, which move in and around the space. Sixteen of the performers also move in and around the space, sometimes on the platforms.
Bright lights around the stage area are strongly re­flected by the white cos­tumes of the 16 moving per­formers. The extreme intensity or light bouncing off the costumes modifies the lines of the human body. At times there are no lights. I am interested in creating a middle ground between see­ing and not seeing.
The principal visual ele­ments of the piece are mov­ing performers, lights, dark­ness, remote control plat­ forms, and movement. It is my main intention to make all these elements equal in energy and visibility.

A dance consisting of two separate but parallel (simultaneous) continuities and two separate (but equal) control systems. 1. Perform­er continuity controlled by me from a remote ""plotting"" table where I will spontane­ously choose the actions and placement of people and ob­jects (from a pre-determined list of possibilities) and com­municate those decisions to the 10-odd performers via walkie-talkie. 2. Event con­tinuity to be controlled by TEEM (theatre electronic en­vironment modular system) in its memory capacity. This part will consist of sequen­tial events that will include movie fragments, slide pro­jections, light changes, TV­ monitored close-ups of de­ tails in the dance-proper, tape recorded monologues and dialogues, and various photo-chemicaI phenomena, several involving ultra-violet light.

A68 9 Evenings: Theatre & Engineering Program,Q19776,"My piece begins with an authentic tennis game with rackets wired for transmission of sound. The sound of the game will control the lights. The game's end is the moment the hall is totally dark. The darkness is illu­sionary. The hall is flooded with infra-red (so far invisible to the human eye). A modestly choreographed cast of from 300 to 500 people will enter and be ob­ served and projected by in­frared television on large screens for the audience. This is the limit of the realization of the piece to date.
Tennis is movement. Put in the context of  theater  it is a formal dance improvisa­tion. The unlikely use of the game to control the lights and to perform as an orches­tra interests me. The con­flict of not being able to see an event that is taking place right in front of one except through a reproduction is the sort of double exposure of action. A screen of light and a screen of darkness.

The support of the Down­ town Community School is responsible for the large cast in Open Score. Through the management of Marilyn Wood and the cooperation of parents and interested par­ties, the cast has been gen­erously collected. The sources are varied and rich in intentions.    The result of their voluntary involvement reaps the Downtown Com­munity School $1000 for a scholarship fund. I would like to draw attention to the fact that all the names were not available at the time this program went to press. They should all be personally re­corded, but the next best thing to do is to report that they well represent the world (our society) and are locally from such varied organizations  as  high school science classes,   drama   organizations , senior citizens groups, individual artists, reformed addicts' club and a New York fencing club. I am touched by the positive support, work, art, love and people.

A189 9 Evenings correspondence,Q19849,"Gentlemen:
On behalf of the Tekniska Museet and Dagens Nyheter we wish to express our appreciation and sincere gratitude for all your interested efforts and hard work, you have devoted to engineer all kinds of new and brilliant projects for the Festival of Art and Technology. Though the Festival will not take place in Stockholm which we regret very deeply we are convinced that your work will prove to be a fruitful contribution to the advancement of both Art and Technology. With the Festival now being launched in the New York Armory rich in traditions we hope that the event will be a great succes, and that this will give you full compensation for the frustrating difficulties entangled in the Stockholm project. We wish you good luck. Should you happen to pass through Stockholm in the future, don't hesitate to get in touch with us",164
A193 9 Evenings correspondence,Q19854,"Dear Vera:

In our telephone conversation the other day you asked for more information on the 1966 Festival of Theater and Engineering. I hope this will give you a clear idea of what we are doing.

""We"" are 10 New York artists:

Lucinda Childs - choreographer, dancer
John Cage - composer, writer
Oyvind Fahlstrom - painter, poet
Alex Hay - painter, choreographer
Deborah Hay - choreographer, dancer
Claes Oldenburg - painter, happening-author
Steve Paxton - choreographer, dancer
Robert Whitman - sculptor, happening-author
David Tudor - musician

and myself. All the artists have exhibited/performed their works here in the past and all are artists of great reputation and daring. We are all involved in our own individual ways of experimenting with modern technology and exploring the possibilities of the interaction between art and professional technology.

Since last January we have been working steadily with about 30 engineers from Bell Laboratories led by Billy Klüver, the technical engineer for Tinguely, Johns and others. The artists suggested ideas and problems for performance situations and the engineers came up with ingenious technical solutions. In the spring we began building equipment and now we have almost all the devices completed. The cooperation of the artists and scientists has produced very exciting and POSITIVE achievements.

Originally we were to perform in a Festival of Art and Technology in Stockholm this September. However, serious differences arose between our Swedish sponsor and ourselves in attitude and approach toward the Festival. These conflicts prevented the rapport necessary for this large scale international project. Although the cancellation of the Stockholm arrangements was a rough setback, the American artists and scientists refused to lose the courage of their commitment. Together we have resolved to make a success of the Festival here in New York.",373
A193 9 Evenings correspondence,Q19855,"PAGE TWO
Our plans are as follows:

11 performances, from October 13 - 23, 1966. The Festival will be held at the Armory at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street, a marvelous space for our performances. The budget is $50,000, covering the cost of designing and building the technical equipment, production costs, rental of the Armory, lighting stage expenses, insurance fees and the like.

We anticipate a minimum audience of 10,000 people. This is a conservative estimate, since there will be thorough press coverage. LIFE, ESQUIRE, and other national magazines plan feature stories. Of course, the art, dance/music and science/engineering publications will give us very heavy before and after coverage. Some interest has been expressed by a television network for a special on the Festival, and several local TV stations plan some coverage. In addition, a new environmental publication called BROADSIDE, published by Marion Javits and Clay Felker, will devote its entire first issue (guest edited by me) to the Festival.

Even with capacity crowds, however, the Festival is not a “commercial” venture. Any profits will go towards a new foundation for the development our ideas. Art critics and philosophers have recently become excited by the interaction of the two formerly opposite poles of art and technology. Scientists and artists have much to learn from each other and their exchange has unknown possibilities. This inter-discipline activity is inevitable, but we feel we can give it an immediate push-in the right direction. X

As LIFE magazine says in its current issue, the Festival ""which will take place in the same Armory the 1913 Armory Show, may go down in art history as another landmark.” In my opinion, LIFE was being too cautious.  The Festival will be a unique avant garde occurrence. New ground needs to be broken and it should be here in New York, the vital center of art and technology.

Vera, I hope that you will share our enthusiasm and give us your financial support. Since we are pressed by time, I would appreciate your reactions as soon as possible.

With thanks in advance.",441

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19968,"An interview with Julie Martin: It was the first performance at the Reuben Gallery in the fall of ’59. People began calling Anita Reuben [née Rubin], who owned the gallery, and her husband at the time, Max Baker, who was handling publicity, and asking, “When’s the next happening?” Max Baker liked the word and they began to use the word for all of the performances the artists were doing from then on. Red Grooms did, I believe, “plays”; Whitman always talked about “theater performances” or “theater pieces”; Oldenburg called his performance series Ray Gun Theater; and Jim Dine also talked about “painter’s theater.” Their works always had a script or score and was always a distinction between the audience and the performers, even if the action sometimes surrounded the audience, as in Whitman’s Flower when some actions took place behind the rows of audience seats, or in Night Time Sky, where the audience sat in a large white cloth dome and events took place in alcoves above their heads and films were projected on the dome walls. Or in Oldenburg’s Ray Gun Theater, the audience was lined up along the walls in a very long narrow space. Kaprow went on to do pieces where he involved the audience. For instance he carried people into the large waiting room at Grand Central Station [New York; Calling, 1965]. If you want to use the word Happenings, there is a tradition and a trajectory that Kaprow started and pursued very different from the others. These other artists really were talking about theater and a new form of theater. So that’s why I don’t call them Happenings.
 Billy has talked about working with Claes—that Claes would write a script, and this was Ray Gun Theater when he did the series, then people would rehearse during the week and perform it on the weekends. And then next week there’d be a new script. Dine’s was more psychological, about himself a lot. But Whitman always said you could redo his pieces. He talks about scripts or scores with the idea of performing them in the future. His was a form of non-narrative, image- based theater. This is why I say the difference. Now, unfortunately, [Mildred L.] Milly Glimcher gave in and called her book Happenings[: New York, 1958–1963, 2012]. I like to make the distinction and I think the artists feel pretty strongly about it.",539
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19974,"An interview with Julie Martin: Very straightforward, very direct. Once he had a piece going, [he was] very clear about what he wanted. But, very much, you had the responsibility for doing it. Whitman always flirted with disaster. He was always pushing himself further. If something went wrong, it was like he accepted it. Not happy about it but—and I think Bob [Rauschenberg] was the same way, about always pushing oneself, having new ideas, never repeating.
 Okay. Happenings. They weren’t Happenings. I have to talk—this is another hobbyhorse. But the point is, it started with a group of young artists being interested in doing performance. Whitman, actually, had gone to Columbia to be a playwright. I mean, he’d been in Rutgers [University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] to be a playwright. Then he took a year at Columbia, which he dropped out of. His interest was really in a kind of theater. Then he got, through the people he knew at Rutgers, like Lucas Samaras, a fellow student, and [Allan] Kaprow, who was his professor for some courses. He started making art or became as interested in making art. Through Kaprow he was in one of the last Hansa Gallery shows in New York in January of 1959. Also, he was in New Media—New Forms at the Martha Jackson Gallery [New York] in June 1960. [Note: The exhibition is also referred to as New Forms—New Media.] There were two influential Martha Jackson shows in 1960 and 1961. He was in at least one of them. Kaprow of course had published his now famous article on “The Legacy of Jackson Pollock” [1958], and how from Pollock’s overall paintings, art was moving off the canvas into what were called “environments” in those days—probably called installations today—and he talked about performances.",409
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19975,"An interview with Julie Martin: In this instance he asked for nature films and in particular he wanted penguins. Some things he shot himself. He shot film of people having tea underwater. It was in the pool at the Sculls’ [Robert C. and Ethel Scull] house on Long Island. He projected that film on the floor in 9 Evenings. He also shot footage for Two Holes of Water in which he used a mirror set up so he had the images of the front and back of a girl superimposed on each other. For Untitled, he himself had found a film of a spleen operation, part of which he projected with the accompanying soundtrack. It was extraordinary. Since I heard it so many times, those words in the narration still resound: “downward through the pericardial membrane.” But Bob did ask for film of penguins, like he had some idea there. He didn’t say which penguin film. If I hadn’t found penguins, he would have used something else, I’m sure. He had people he liked to work with who he asked to be in his pieces—Simone, Trisha, Susanne de Maria, Mimi Stark. But often it was people who were around. My roommate Jackie Leavitt was the typist in the 9 Evenings piece. He didn’t necessarily pick people with special qualities.
 Billy says that Claes did—that Claes would sometimes pick people who filled some kind of role he had in mind. Billy and his then girlfriend, Letty Eisenhauer, were in one of the first pieces at the Ray Gun Theater and had specific interactions that reflected their relationship in real life. Claes had his group of players who were in a lot of his Ray Gun Theater pieces: his wife Patty, Lucas Samaras, and Gloria Graves. But more than Whitman or Dine he would somehow suit the role to the person. Whitman had people who would work with him. He feels the work developed through the performances. He would say, “Do it a very direct way, no theatrical flourishes.” A lot of the activity was task-based. “Go over and turn on the light, do this.” But of course he worked with Simone who was a consummate performer. In Prune Flat, she was joined by Lucinda.",494
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19972,"An interview with Julie Martin: Training or expertise. Or there’s another word. Oh, I don’t know. That wasn’t part of it. It was certain motions, certain things to do, and you kind of just did them. He would rehearse but he wouldn’t rehearse the night before and be all, “I have to have it perfect.” There was no sense of it had to be perfect. It was like, “This is a script. This is what you do now. We’ll do it.”",122
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19978,"An interview with Julie Martin: There really is. Somebody who’s written about it and actually has brought it kind of up- to-date is Julia [E.] Robinson. It’s in a catalogue that she did, the last show she did. It was either in MACBA [Museu d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona] in Barcelona or [Museo Nacional Centro de Arte] Reina Sofía [Madrid], a show called New Realisms[: 1957–1962, Object Strategies Between Readymade and Spectacle, 2010; Madrid]. It was about that period, ’61 and ’63. She gets it about Whitman’s roots coming out of the theater. He’s the only one who really has persisted in making theater pieces. I mean, Claes did a new piece once in Venice in the eighties or nineties but essentially he worked in sculpture. Dine concentrated on painting and was the first of the group to move uptown, having been taken on by Martha Jackson Gallery. [Laughter] Then Bob Rauschenberg got more involved in doing performances. He, of course, had been working with Merce Cunningham since 1954 doing lights and costumes, and from 1962, with the dancers at the Judson Church, also doing lights. The story is that when Alice Denney, encouraged by Billy, organized a Pop art show, The Popular Image, in spring 1963 for the Washington Gallery of Modern Art in Washington, D.C., she included a concert of dances by members of the Judson Dance Theater, and in the announcement for the series, the Pop [Art] Festival, she had listed Bob [Rauschenberg] as choreographer. So he rose to the challenge and made Pelican, performed with Per Olof Ultvedt and himself on roller skates wearing those very large parachute “wings” on their backs and Cunningham dancer, Carolyn Brown, in point shoes at a roller rink in Washington, D.C. He continued doing performances during ’63 and ’64, especially working with Steve Paxton and Alex and Deborah Hay. During Merce Cunningham’s world tour, the four of them did performances in some of the places the company went—at the Sogetsu [Art Center] theater in Tokyo and at Moderna Museet in Stockholm, where Pontus Hultén organized what he called Five New York Evenings, and where Bob R. did Elgin Tie [1964], where a cow was one of the performers.
 Bob R.’s interest in performances developed differently from Whitman and the others. It came out of dance. The first one, Pelican, was billed as a dance and first done as part of a Judson Theater concert out of town, in Washington, D.C. He did some other works as part of the Judson concerts later in 1963 and then during his travels with Merce Cunningham. But as he worked more with performance, his later ones increasingly were progressions of overlapping, changing, distinct images or actions, like Spring Training for the First New York Theater Rally in spring 1965, or Map Room II for the benefit evening at the Cinematheque in December of the same year.
 For Rauschenberg, it was very much the milieu and him being part of it, working with people he knew—primarily Steve, Alex, and Deborah. He did some of those early pieces several times, especially Pelican. But in the 1990s when interest revived in performances of the sixties and people asked to redo works, for example his 9 Evenings piece, Open Score, he said he didn’t want to do the pieces again. They were of the time. I think it’s too bad but he said, “They’re of the time.” It’s sort of like a painting. You can’t make a painting again thirty years later.",819
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19982,An interview with Julie Martin: I should probably give that to you. That was his reportage on his collaboration with Tinguely—working with Jean on the machine that destroyed itself—that he wrote one or two days after the event.,49
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19983,"Q: That was my impression, that the artist presented a wish list. Then the engineer would approach it as a kind of problem-solving, “How can I make someone float in the air?”",44
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19986,"An interview with Julie Martin: Homage to New York. Right. And after that experience Billy wanted to keep working with artists very much. So he would say to artists whom he was getting to know, “Do you have an idea that needs an engineer?” Jasper [Johns], for example, came up with the idea of using a neon letter in a painting and not having the painting attached to the wall by wires. He asked for portable neon. In the different collaborations that Billy had before E.A.T.—and it was also true with E.A.T.—the impetus came from the artist. It didn’t mean the work didn’t change once the artist and engineer were working together, but the impetus—the basic idea—came from the artist. For example, Andy Warhol asked for a floating light bulb. When battery technology made it that the bulb would have to be as big as a house to float, Andy looked at the heat-sealable material Billy had found for him and asked for clouds. While Billy and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories were trying to figure out how to heat-seal rounded shapes and not have them fall over, Andy simply folded the material over and made his rectangular Silver Clouds [1966].",259
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19987,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. But if it would come about that certain things wouldn’t work, then the engineer might say, “It doesn’t exactly work this way but how about this?” Then the idea was that it would be a dialogue. The engineer wouldn’t contribute art, god forbid. But he would contribute a solution that might change the look or make the piece work slightly differently.",89
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19984,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. That’s why Billy always emphasized the collaboration between artists and engineers, not scientists. He felt that engineers were problem-solvers—hands-on kind of people—and this was what was needed in working with artists. He was never a fan of “art and science” but more “art and engineering.”",77
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19990,"Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about your own life. Then I did want to ask you some of your sense of Billy’s history—his history going a little further back—of collaboration. But to stick with your story for a minute, would the first time you would have seen Rauschenberg in person, or seen a work by Rauschenberg, have been at that benefit for Jonas Mekas in December of ’65 when you went to see the Whitman and the Oldenburg and the Rauschenberg piece? Would that have been your first encounter with Rauschenberg?",126
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19988,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, none of that. There wasn’t a sense of that kind of collaboration for those performances. It was his piece. You’re working on it. You may contribute suggestions on how to do physical things. Often a lot of the preparation is figuring out how to do things—achieve the image he has in his mind. When that is going on Bob accepts suggestions readily. But if someone’s suggestion is not acceptable to him, he will just say, “That’s another piece.” But there’s no sense of, “It’s our piece together,” or anything like that. Even Simone, who worked with him and obviously contributed—and her persona was very strong—but it was never any sense of, “Oh, it’s Simone’s piece too.” In fact we were talking recently and saying that everything in Whitman’s pieces were part of the development of the image or images. The objects and the performers had the same functions—object as performer and performer as object to move or be projected on.
 The same was true of Bob R.’s performance pieces too. He had very worked-out ideas and actions of what he wanted and the performers worked according to his ideas. Of course, often these instructions left room for the performer to feel comfortable in the role and work out how best to do it. For example, in Linoleum [1966], Steve Paxton was lying down on a long board on wheels with a chicken-wire dome over it with chickens in the space with him and he was eating fried chicken. He wheeled his structure around the space. Bob himself had one activity to set down, one at a time, several “floats”—small white geometric-shaped sculptures by Robert Breer—that moved very, very slowly on the floor. He would draw a chalk line around one of the sculptures and then it would move away. A bit later in the piece, Bob would draw another chalk line around the float in its new position. I remember another performer, maybe Deborah or Alex, made a line on the floor using cooked spaghetti from a bowl in the lap of the woman sitting in an ornate chair—Simone Forti in the Washington production. Very strong images but no theatrical flourishes. Of course, everyone worked together to make the performances work and each contributed in his or her own way but there was clear authorship. It’s the nature of theater and of choreography, don’t you think?
 The idea of collaboration between artists and engineers came later and was articulated at the time of E.A.T. In fact, I remember—just talking about collaboration—I remember when I started working with Billy and with E.A.T., all of a sudden, they talked about “collaboration” and I found that word was very strange because the only way I had heard the word being used was in reference to World War II. And collaboration in that context was a negative word. I remember it took a while for me to get used to that word in that new context. It was Billy and Bob R. who used and developed the idea of one-to-one collaboration between artists and engineers. Bob R. in particular—Billy says that. He remembered that his first ideas about engineers working with artists was that the engineer would furnish the artists with a new palette. He used that metaphor. A palette for the artist. The new possibilities. He saw the engineer as offering the artist new possibilities.",741
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19989,"An interview with Julie Martin: I saw Rauschenberg’s show [Robert Rauschenberg] at the Jewish Museum [New York] in the spring of 1963. I remember seeing that. And seeing the large painting, Barge [1962–63]. Incredible. It was along the wall in a room that was wood-paneled. It’s not the same anymore but you know, there was a white room and then you went into sort of the space next door. Then the Barge was just incredible. I remember seeing that so I knew who Bob was. But, I certainly didn’t know about the performances he was beginning to do, Pelican, the stuff in Sweden, Elgin Tie, or anything like that.",156
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19995,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, with the cow. The next things I did see were in 1965, Spring Training at the First New York Theater Rally and Map Room II in December. He did Pelican again in Washington in 1966, for what Alice Denney called the NOW Festival. I was there for that and he did perform it at the First New York Theater Rally in spring 1965 with Alex Hay as the other man.",86
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19999,"An interview with Julie Martin: Billy’s. He saw technology as offering a new palette. This is from somebody from outside the art world. Another element in Billy’s thinking from the beginning was the idea of the individual could influence the larger systems he was contributing to, the idea of the individual taking responsibility for his work. He wrote about this in 1960 in a piece he published in Alfred Leslie’s Hasty Papers [1960], a “Fragment on Man and the System.” In his early collaborations with [Jean] Tinguely and Bob R., he saw in particular that the artist takes full responsibility for his work, and by working with engineers, it would encourage the engineer to take responsibility for the systems he was working on. Billy soon came to feel that it was the engineer who needed to work with the artist. That the engineer could benefit in his professional capacity through working with the artist. Not in the way of discovering new equipment or technical ideas but in using his knowledge in a new situation and enriching his own way of working. The engineer could offer the artist a new palette but the artists could offer the engineer a new sense of possibilities in his work as well. Billy said it was Bob [Rauschenberg] who articulated this idea of collaboration in the sense of individuals working one-to-one. Billy developed it and articulated it but he has always said that it started with Bob—Bob always talked about collaborating with his materials even earlier—before there were other people involved in the mix. This whole idea of a collaboration of equals very much came out of Bob. Or let’s say Billy’s working with Bob.
 Although, he saw in his work—and he’s written about that. Do you know his piece, The Garden Party [1960]?

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20007,"An interview with Julie Martin: Not even then, really. I was pretty much working with Whitman. I was sort of peripheral in 9 Evenings. I mean, working with Whitman. Then, once people moved into the armory, then everybody got—what do you call it—drafted to do everything. I was soldering tiny plugs onto audio wires.",73
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20004,An interview with Julie Martin: I think. I remember the girls walking around with crackers. Or Bob taking the turtles out of a large container and setting them loose to move around the space. The turtles with—,43
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20010,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, exactly. We moved into the armory on October 8 and the first performance was October 13. I remember helping Pontus with the catalogue—maybe proofreading or going to the printer—because somehow, then, they discovered that I could spell. I always say, “Because I could spell”—that’s why they asked me to be editor of the newsletter because artists are terrible spellers.",91
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20011,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, not during 9 Evenings. No, it was the next summer. That was the summer of ’67 because they came out to the Hamptons in the summer of ’67. Yes, the next year. And Olga [Adorno] was really, really pregnant. Then Kristian [Klüver] was born that September. So I think that’s when I kind of met Billy. The next summer I worked again for Christophe, the summer of 1967.",109
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20009,"An interview with Julie Martin: No. I don’t know if I saw it at Leo [Castelli]’s or not. It’s possible because at that point, Robert and I would be following things and Castelli was one of the people you followed. But I can’t say that I had.
 Oh, I know! ’65, the First New York Theater Rally. So I saw Spring Training and Pelican because Robert and I were going to all of those performances, primarily because of Whitman. I wasn’t working with Whitman yet but Robert and I went to all his performances. That was the spring of ’65. May, I think.",144
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20018,Q: And E.A.T. was founded in September of 1966. Do you remember your impressions of that moment and the buildup to 9 Evenings? There was the moment when it was supposed to be in Sweden.,45
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20019,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. Billy and Bob R. used the newsletter to get the news out about E.A.T., to articulate the ideas and goals for the organization and start telling artists what would be available to them from the 9 Evenings equipment or technical help they could get. Also the newsletter announced events and activities aimed at recruiting engineers.",72
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20022,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, I wasn’t part of that at all. I was working weekends for Whitman. I wasn’t part of any of that. I know the history now because I’ve started studying it. But I didn’t know it at all at the time. I may have gone to the technical rehearsal, which was in the gymnasium of the Berkeley School in Berkeley Heights [New Jersey] where Billy was living and just down the road from Bell Labs in Murray Hill [New Jersey]. I’m not sure I was there. I’ve seen so many photos of the day that I feel as if I was there. But maybe not.",145
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20023,"An interview with Julie Martin: There was a press conference for the 9 Evenings held in the chapel at Bob [Rauschenberg]’s place [Lafayette Street studio, New York]. It was for the artists and engineers working on the 9 Evenings to talk with the press sometime in September in 1966. I was not really part of the artists and engineers group. I was working with Whitman. But then afterwards, I helped Simone write her piece for Artforum. That came out in February of ’67. [Note: Simone Forti, then Simone Whitman, “Theater and Engineering: An Experiment, 1. Notes by a Participant.”]",139
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20026,"An interview with Julie Martin: Then Kristian was born in September ’67. The summer of 1967 I was working for Christophe, organizing a second Midsummer series. She invited Bob Whitman to do another piece, called Shirt. I don’t remember too much about it. It took place in the woods of the artist Constantino Nivola, who was a friend of Christophe’s. Terry [M.] Riley and Trisha Brown also did pieces that summer in a tent set up next to Nivola’s studio. Toward the end of those performances, Billy—and maybe Bob R. was with him, must have been—came out to Christophe’s and I remember sitting on the beach and talking about E.A.T. and what to do. I wasn’t working for them yet. Then I came back to the city from working on Midsummer. I worked for Channel Thirteen—again I put my Russian Institute knowledge to use and worked on the Russian Revolution. I was doing research for a few weeks. Soon after this, sometime during the fall of 1967, Billy and [Frederick D.] Fred [Waldhauer] asked me to come to work at E.A.T. as editor of the newsletter. The first issue of the E.A.T. News where I was listed as editor was published November 1, 1967. Certainly from then on, I worked for E.A.T.",306
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20024,"An interview with Julie Martin: In that time period, I worked with Simone to put her notes together and help her structure her article. I began to know a little bit about the preparations for 9 Evenings from working with her. I didn’t work with Billy on his article, which accompanied hers.",62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20030,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, during the 9 Evenings there wasn’t time for that kind of thinking. There was the need to get things done. Everybody was working all the time. Artists, engineers, friends. Getting everything to work. It was a bit insane, looking back on it, that they planned to have two different artists each night so there had to be new setups during intermission. The engineers had planned for that to some extent by developing the TEEM [Theatrical Electronic Environmental Module], a modular control system that the different performances could plug into. But there were the physical setups as well. Of course, there was the excitement that the collaborations between artists and engineers was working. The works were being shown to a larger audience than they had ever been before—more than fifteen hundred people each night. But the demands of the performances overrode everything else.
 For me, the intellectual excitement came later when it was more the idea that this was something really worth doing. No, I remember somehow, at one point, maybe being out in Berkeley Heights, talking with Billy—maybe when he was talking about my coming to work for him. I remember specifically the idea that the collaboration between artists and engineers not only benefits the artists but also could benefit the engineers and the development of technology. And wow, I remember thinking that idea was amazing. That same sense of something intellectually thrilling—like hearing Castro, right? Always seduced by ideas. And I remember coming back to my apartment on Thompson Street and telling, very specifically, my boyfriend at the time who was an actor, Danny Goldman, how exciting these ideas were and how appealing the possibilities of these ideas were. There definitely was a moral dimension and idealistic dimension to these ideas.",356
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20031,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, exactly. Nothing wrong with charisma. But I remember that. I’m not sure exactly where in there. It was certainly after 9 Evenings and maybe even before I came to work for E.A.T. But just somehow, the idea hit me that, “Wow, this is worth doing.”",74
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20028,"Q: So many of these names are so monumental at this point. With hindsight it means something different to say Simone Forti in that period. Here’s another young person who’s trying to figure out who they are and what they’re doing as an artist and what they’re doing in their life. I’m just trying to get a sense of whether you felt in the moment, “Wow, this is a really interesting idea where we have these engineers and artists coming together and I’m in the middle of something— at least really cool and exciting.”",125
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20032,"An interview with Julie Martin: Billy articulating it to me. Billy’s idea about saving engineering was one he had had for a long time. He articulated it in some early things he wrote. He had wanted the individual engineer to be more aware of what he/she was doing and to see they could affect the systems they were working on. And then he saw the artist as this vehicle for stimulating change. I think that Bob understood it too and it was important. But I think his interest came from the art side and increasing the possibilities for art and art changing the world. That art would change the world. I think commitment to the engineer as an equal was in it.
 One of the things he’d wanted to do early on—as a young person, he was a film nut. He saw films in Stockholm. I think he went regularly to every film that came to Stockholm in the forties—what could come into Sweden during the war and after. He kept a notebook where he entered every film he saw: the title, the director, his rating, and his comments. He was president of the university Student Film Society and was getting from the American Embassy, during the war, Hollywood and avant-garde American films—you know, Maya Deren and the Whitney brothers [James Whitney and John Whitney, Sr.]—to Sweden to show. When he came here, he continued that interest in film. He said he immigrated to the United States because he wanted to see what it looked like, having seen it in the movies. He always had this insatiable curiosity about what things looked like.
 When he was at the Kungliga Tekniska högskolan [Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm] and studying electrical engineering, for his senior thesis he made a film—an animated film— Motion of Electrons in Electric and Magnetic Fields [1951]. He and his friend, Nils Hugo Geber, who became a film historian and theorist, used Disney-type cells to show the little electrons moving along a vacuum tube and then being deflected in various patterns by the electrical and then magnetic fields. His professor was Hannes Alfvén, who had won the Nobel Prize for physics. He accepted Billy’s film. Many years later, Billy was very proud because Alfvén wrote a science fiction book, The Tale of the Big Computer [1968], in English. He wrote it under a pseudonym. Then when it came out in Sweden, he sent Billy a copy of the book with the dedication, “Thank you for your film.” So it was unique.",535
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20038,"Q: For him, that’s part of the attraction of the collaboration, where you put the engineering next to or in conversation with the art. It allows the scientist or the engineer to hook into that outside system.",45
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20037,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. It was about the breakdown of the great computer running the whole society. So Billy was very interested in educational films. When he first came to this country in 1954, he tried to sell the idea of producing educational films on a college level. He had made an English translation of the Motion of Electrons film to show in the U.S. and tried to get his idea produced. He went to Encyclopedia Britannica, who was the major maker of educational films, and they said, “No, no. We do grade school and high school films. It will never work on the higher level.” I think he went to Hollywood and talked to people there too.
 He had this interest in working with education, with technology. As he began to work as an engineer, he increasingly realized the limitations in many of his fellow engineers’ thinking and wanted to break them. He says at some point—I don’t remember where he’s written it—he began to see the artist as a vehicle, this kind of revolutionary vehicle. That the artist, in working with the engineer, could change the engineer’s idea about what he or she was doing. I think that idea he had was very strong with him. I think Bob liked it and picked up on it. But I think Bob was very much still in the art world.",284
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20042,"Q: Can I read you a quote? This is the Japanese 2003 catalogue on E.A.T. [E.A.T.—The Story of Experiments in Art and Technology]. Billy has this prefatory essay and what you just said reminds me of—I think this is what you mean. Maybe this is what you’re thinking of. This is Billy: “At the time, I was doing a lot of thinking about the development of the new technology and our ability to affect it in ways more positive for the individual. In an article I wrote in 1959, ‘Fragment on Man and the System,’ I argued that individual engineers and scientists have total responsibility for the technology he or she is creating in the direction technology takes.
 Engineers and scientists have to be aware that technology is not on one unchangeable path. Its direction can be constantly changed and it can go in all directions. But the engineer or scientist goes through years of formal training in the language and practice of science. He can make a discovery or break through that and expand scientific knowledge but his contribution still remains within a mutually agreed scientific system. Art, on the other hand, is outside any such system. An artist’s ideas are capable of transcending or radically expanding the boundaries of Western thought. For me, the act of [Marcel] Duchamp choosing the snow shovel is the best example of one person’s ability to shatter classic boundaries in art and thinking.” That sounds like that’s almost what you were talking about.",318
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20043,"Q: Right. The payoff for the engineer, then—I’m just re-reiterating what you were saying— would be really expanding and shifting and making you question your own thinking about your process.",44
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20040,"An interview with Julie Martin: E.A.T., right. So that’s sort of an example. I think the irony that, since certain facets of the technology have gone that way of breaking down monolithic technological systems—and with the cell phone, with the personal computer, the internet—the individual has gotten access to movie-making, music-making, et cetera, and communication. We have access to vast new sources of information. Some of the ideas stated in the early aims of E.A.T. have come to fruition. Technological development has brought a new set of problems facing the individual.
 God forbid your utopia comes true. Look where we are.",143
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20046,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. But that was the idea. Certainly things have changed for the artist in relation to his or her access to new materials. In those days, an artist who wanted to work with plastics—the industry would say, “We can give you a truckload but you can’t have one or two pieces of anything.” They were shut out from access to what Billy could see were developments in materials, developments in communication technology, this kind of thing. That was the idea— that the artist could get in through this human connection with an engineer, working with an engineer who had the knowledge. There was no reason for the artist to acquire this knowledge or training. This was the domain of the engineer who had spent his life learning his profession. They were artists, after all.",166
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20045,"Q: Not necessarily the expectation that the work I’m doing with Rauschenberg or Whitman, or whatever particular artist, is going to invent some new, earth-shattering technology in itself.",42
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20050,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think Bob [Rauschenberg] understood the danger of artists and engineers being so separate from each other—as he said, groups unrealistically developing in isolation from each other—and he was never an artist who stuck only to paint and canvas. He was always reaching out into the world around him and, in his collaborations with Billy, he could see the possibilities the technical world offered but also how far away it was from the art world.
 These things are never really spelled out but I think the technical community and technology was more monolithic in those days. The individual didn’t have access to the system. The wording that he and Bob used was about making technology more accessible to the individual and for the individual’s enjoyment—individual enrichment and pleasure.
 Here are the aims they collaborated in writing for the 1967 press conference: “Maintain a constructive climate for the recognition of the new technology and the arts by a civilized collaboration between groups unrealistically developing in isolation. Eliminate the separation of the individual from technological change and expand and enrich technology to give the individual variety, pleasure, and avenues for exploration and involvement in contemporary life. Encourage industrial initiative in generating original forethought, instead of a compromise in aftermath, and precipitate a mutual agreement in order to avoid the waste of a cultural revolution.” [Note: Published in E.A.T. News (New York) 1, no. 3 (Nov. 1, 1967), p. 5.]
 Those three incomprehensible goals of E.A.T. that they wrote. I’m being facetious. They were not incomprehensible but they certainly had Bob’s wonderful, complex language. Billy later said that Bob essentially wrote the first and third of the aims and he wrote the second one. I recently noticed that they don’t say anything about making art. The aims really were about both bringing different communities—the art community, the technical community, and the industrial community—in the society to work together. And also about empowering the individual. That the development of technology could empower the individual and improve each individual’s life. That was the idea that they agreed on. Billy saw the artist as the supreme individual in the sense of not just making art—that wasn’t interesting—but being the person who took responsibility for his or her own work. With the artist, there was never any kind of apologies like, “Oh, if I had more time, the art would have been better.”",518
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20055,"An interview with Julie Martin: Or to understand that the way the artist works could prompt the engineer to question or expand his own system. Ask different questions of it. See different possibilities in it. I don’t think Billy ever thought that the artist and the engineer working together was going to make any kind of scientific discovery. He always said, “You’re kind of working on a lower level.” You may be at the forefront of engineering technology and ingenuity but you’re not at the forefront of knowledge. But the possibility of asking different questions of what you’re doing was the idea of the value of the collaboration the engineer could have with an artist. The engineer could make decisions or devise things and use his skills in ways he hadn’t considered before. Fred Waldhauer is one of the engineers who most—besides Billy—most got it.
 He saw some of the same confining limitations of the developing technology that Billy saw and always said, you can’t get out of the technological world but you can make it better. It was Fred who coined what I’ve always thought was one of the best descriptions of the artist’s role in this: “In designing and building the future, we are all amateurs, but the artist may be the best amateur.” To go back, Fred had been a great fan of jazz during his days at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], traveling to New York City to go to the clubs. He in his own work at Bell Labs worked on the advanced T1 digital switching system. In the seventies he took time off and wrote a very technical study of feedback, which was of course one of the electronic phenomena that engaged David [E.] Tudor in his performance and composition. He was very close to David—built the Proportional Control System for him for 9 Evenings—and worked with him in developing the sound system for the Pepsi Pavilion [Expo ’70, Osaka, Japan, 1970]. And in the 1980s he developed the first digital hearing aid. His mother was going deaf so he had some idea of the problems. He tells that one day he was driving in his very rattley Toyota and listening to music on the radio and he realized that just making things louder didn’t help. You still couldn’t hear the music. With his knowledge of digital technology at Bell Labs, he devised the first programmable hearing aid that would raise only the frequencies that the person was deficient in. He individualized the hearing aid.",528
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20052,"An interview with Julie Martin: Not that I know of. One of the things I think about—well, there was one phosphor that they used in Steve Paxton’s piece in 9 Evenings that an engineer wrote up later in a technical journal. It would change color with heat on the skin. It could be used to detect the path of laser beams operating above the visible spectrum. Certainly this development of FM transmitters.
 Billy and his colleagues at Bell Labs first started it with Yvonne Rainer, when they built this little FM transmitter that transmitted the sound of her breathing as she danced.",124
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20053,An interview with Julie Martin: More they weren’t interested. You were at Bell Labs. People weren’t entrepreneurs at that time. Also all the patents at Bell Labs were available to be licensed by others at that time. It was one of the conditions of the government support of AT&T as a monopoly.,66
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20057,"Q: Bell Labs is the other part of the story that is fascinating to me. He talks about it a little bit here and there—the question of why did Bell Labs let these engineers—at one point, talking about 9 Evenings in one of the essays he co-wrote with you, he says something like, “The dozens of engineers who worked on this piece put in something like eight thousand hours working.”",87
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20060,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, number one, all the engineers worked on their own time. It was all on their own time—nights and weekends—and later when we moved into the armory, in the days before the performances, the engineers took vacation time.",56
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20061,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. That may have been the first wireless FM transmitter. Then the engineers developed a wireless FM transmitting system for 9 Evenings. They designed and built wireless amplifiers, transmitters, coders and decoders, et cetera—a whole stage system that ran on batteries. They called it the TEEM system. But nobody thought about patenting or commercially developing it. Then wireless technology for the stage developed in the trade. So now what? You can have stage production with fifteen or twenty different wireless mics on stage. The engineers working on 9 Evenings developed the equipment out of this need of the artists to do those certain pieces. But it wasn’t seen, necessarily, as something you would go ahead and pursue because that wasn’t what they were working on day to day. The engineers designed special equipment for the 9 Evenings but it was very much their response to the needs of the artists in performance. For example, Fred Waldhauer’s Proportional Control System that allowed him to move sound from speaker to speaker for David Tudor’s piece.",230
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20066,"Q: —the construction he built, the self-destroying installation he built with Jean Tinguely. Then it was through that—because Rauschenberg came into that and built the little mascot—",43
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20067,Q: Money Thrower—that he met Rauschenberg and started working with Rauschenberg. Do you have a sense of how Billy met Tinguely? How did he first start getting involved in the art world?,48
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20071,"Q: That initial instruction from Pontus’s letter was just, well, “He’s in New York. He may need help. Go ask him what he needs.”",41

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19890,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. I went to undergraduate Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and studied philosophy. I did my thesis on [Karl] Marx and [Ludwig] Feuerbach and the theory of alienation. But I was getting more and more interested in the Soviet Union and I took a couple of courses on Russia and the Soviet Union at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. I can’t remember what they are right at this moment, though I do remember auditing the famous course that was usually taught by Merle Fainsod but that year was being taught by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later came to the Russian Institute at Columbia [University, New York]. So I decided to go to graduate school for Russian studies. Rather than stay at Harvard, I decided to go to Columbia, to the Russian Institute. In those days, it was pretty easy to get fellowships. The government was giving out fellowships to study the Soviet Union. So I think they paid me to go, or at least the tuition. As I remember.",221
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19888,"An interview with Julie Martin: I remember we had works by [László] Moholy-Nagy and Karl Zerbe and Alexander Archipenko. No, it was the art itself, much of it abstract and non-objective, very unlike the Socialist Realism that reigned in the Soviet Union. I remember going to visit Archipenko in his studio in New York—he was still alive at the time—and interviewing him so I could talk better about his work in that exhibit. Then we were supposed to talk about the art. There was another section that was about the use of plastics in the home, in the kitchen. So you show the magnificent American kitchen. Then there was Plastics in Industry, [Plastics] in Recreation, [Plastics] in the Office, et cetera. So it was a whole kind of propagandistic thing. Then Plastics in Art was one section.",189
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19889,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, let me think. I graduated college in 1960. So it would have been the summer of ’60. Then I went to Columbia for one year. Then the next summer, 1961, I went to the Soviet Union as a guide on the USIA exhibition Plastics USA. I worked in the section Plastics in Art. That was mostly the summer. And I decided to go back to Columbia rather than go to Washington [D.C.] and join the government working on the Soviet Union. So I went back to Columbia.",115
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19894,An interview with Julie Martin: Oh my god! I saw [Fidel] Castro. I think that’s the reason I went on to study the Soviet Union. That and reading [Fyodor] Dostoevsky and being curious about the Russian soul. I don’t really know how hearing Castro led to going to Columbia. But just something about it.,78
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19898,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, he came to Harvard in ’59. He came to Harvard. He spoke from a podium outside the sports arena or gymnasium, I seem to remember. It was so inspiring. It was amazing. I mean, the hope of the Cuban revolution was amazing. He spoke to a huge crowd of students. No, it was extraordinary, this idea of freedom. I don’t even know what he said but I remember it was incredibly inspiring. He hadn’t been forced by U.S. sanctions to turn to the Soviet Union yet.
 There was the idea that there was this possibility that this could be a new democratic revolution and a new hope. This was part of the beginning of the sixties idealism.",157
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19896,"An interview with Julie Martin: Stipend or fellowship. So I was in New York and doing that. Then after the first year, I applied for and was accepted to be a guide on a USIA [United States Information Agency] exhibition going to the Soviet Union. In 1959 there had been the first large American exhibition in Moscow, which presented aspects of American life to the Russian public—from art to fashion to industry and consumer goods. This was where [Vice President Richard M.] Nixon and [Soviet Premier Nikita S.] Khrushchev had a famous debate in the model American kitchen. Then there was an agreement to continue this kind of cultural exchange with a smaller exhibition that would travel to other cities in the Soviet Union. The first of these was called Plastics USA [1961], which was organized around all things manufactured by the plastics industry for use in industry, the home, recreation, et cetera. And there was a section called Plastics in Art, which allowed the exhibition organizers to get some abstract art into the Soviet Union. So it was, of course, somewhat propagandistic.
 I was already interested in art. My parents collected locally a little bit and I was already interested in art. I thought this would be a great section to be in. Even though my Russian was not that good, they decided to hire me, I guess, to show that not all the guides on the exhibition were spies. If your Russian isn’t so good, maybe you’re not a trained agent—
 Oh, I forgot! The summer before I started graduate school, I went on an Experiment in International Living trip to the Soviet Union. The usual program of Experiment in International Living, based in Putney, Vermont, was you stay in a house with a family and then a whole group travels in the country, each with the kid in the family they stayed with. Well, of course, you couldn’t do that in the Soviet Union. But we were a group and we did travel around and we stayed for a month at a youth camp on the Black Sea in Sochi. So I did that, so I had this experience being in the Soviet Union.",444
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19900,"An interview with Julie Martin: No. Not at all. For me at that time art was art: [Jackson] Pollock, [Pablo] Picasso. I do remember seeing, at the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard, Käthe Kollwitz⎯who was political in a sense⎯but I responded more to the drawing and the sentiment. I think I liked her the way you like [Pyotr Ilyich] Tchaikovsky when you first start listening to classical music, before moving on to [Johann Sebastian] Bach.",127
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19906,"An interview with Julie Martin: My thesis was more a philosophy thesis than a political science one. The subject was economism, China and Russia and the theory of economism. You know, always in Marxist theory there’s this dichotomy between the socialist revolution that is coming inevitably as the capitalist economy develops and the workers become more and more impoverished and finally rise up⎯ make the revolution⎯and establish the new socialist order versus the idea that the workers must fight and struggle to overthrow [the] capitalist political system and build the new socialist economic and political order. [Vladimir] Lenin very strongly came down on the second side. In his famous political tract, What Is to Be Done? [1902], some of his socialist party colleagues who disagreed with him argued that he turned Marxism on its head. He saw Russia was still almost a feudal country and said, “No, we can’t wait for some vague historical inevitability. We have to take political power and use the political power to build the socialist economic order under it.” So there’s always this tension in Marxist theory and practice.
 [Joseph] Stalin died in 1953 and by 1956, Khrushchev was beginning to criticize the excessive repressive policies of Stalin and to become more “let’s build the economy now” and put some more emphasis on giving the people more consumer goods and economic incentives. Mao [Zedong] and Chinese Communist Party had just seized power in 1949 and were at the ideological stage of using their newly won political power to shape the society. So the fights between the Russians and the Chinese, ideologically, were the use of political power to build the economy and make the social changes, or focus less on political power (and repression) but build the economy as the path toward a socialist society. So that’s what I wrote about.",389
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19910,"An interview with Julie Martin: I was not in the art world at all. I mean, I went to see art. Mainly, I was going to see art. In Boston, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, or the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger museums at Harvard. And like many of my fellow Radcliffe students, I audited Fine Arts 101 but I’m afraid it took place after lunch and I often dozed off in the middle of the Renaissance. Also my parents had been members of the Museum of Modern Art [MoMA, New York] and got many of the catalogues, which were distributed to members in those days, and I remember my parents and I went to see the Pollock exhibition when it took up the whole museum, and in ’57 we saw the Pollock show there. I saw art but I was not in the art world. Sort of never have been, actually, come to think about it.
 [Laughter]",202
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19913,"An interview with Julie Martin: To viewers. I was supposed to talk and answer questions. The idea, I’m sure, was to talk about freedom of expression in the U.S., freedom to make abstract art, et cetera. But the main question they asked was why did I wear my watch on my right arm? Because in the Soviet Union—it was the old system—you were made to be right-handed. So everybody wore their watch on the left arm. So many people noticed. “Why are you wearing your watch on your right arm?” Moscow was a very sophisticated audience. There were debates among the viewers about the art and there were defenders of the abstract art on view. The exhibition traveled to Moscow, Kiev, and Tbilisi. And in Kiev and Tbilisi the reaction of visitors was more conservative. It was like, “Oh, that’s not art.”
 Then that fall I came back to Columbia. But I got more interested in living in New York than going to Columbia so it took me five years to get my master’s [degree] and what they called a certificate from the Russian Institute. Well, it was a two-year program. I have to say that. But Ididn’t finish it until, I guess, fall ’65, when finally they didn’t let you stay at Columbia for fifty dollars a semester. Up until then, as a graduate student, you could just register. If you finished your courses, you could just register and for fifty dollars or something you could stay on. Then all of a sudden, there were charges. You had to pay for at least three points and maybe for a whole semester. I can’t remember. So I finished my thesis very quickly [laughs] and got out.",378
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19918,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, the first artists’ performance, which everyone calls Happenings. But Whitman, [Red] Grooms, [Jim] Dine, [Claes] Oldenburg always called their works some form of theater: Grooms, plays; Whitman, theater pieces; Dine, artists’ theater; Oldenburg called his series Ray Gun Theater [1962], et cetera. Again, this is one of my hobbyhorses: to rescue this work from the label Happenings.
 I knew conventional off-Broadway theater, somewhat—Theater de Lys, the Living Theater productions. I’d followed theater. I’d gone to a lot of theater productions at Harvard. One of the things about Harvard⎯maybe it’s still true⎯but in those days, the student productions were really good and really varied. Plus, in Boston there was some stuff going on that I went to.",207
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19916,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, no. My parents came to visit New York once or twice a year. Yes, they liked to. They came to New York. I remember one time we also went to—it was a big Picasso exhibition where he was in every floor of the Museum of Modern Art and then several galleries around New York. They collected a lot of art locally and our house was filled with paintings and drawings of new young local artists. They did buy some Picasso prints and ceramics over the years. Particularly after I left they were more active that way. But again, none of those debates.",127
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19922,"An interview with Julie Martin: I wanted to work in television. I mean, I graduated—or at least finished—at Columbia in the fall/winter of ’65. I don’t quite remember what I did right after that. Probably looked for work. It was very cheap to live in New York and I had some money saved from the USIA exhibition time (there was nothing to spend money on in the Soviet Union at that time) and maybe the fellowship money and some help from parents.
 Just to get my chronology complete—even though it jumps ahead a little bit—we can do the details later. During the summer of 1966, I was working weekends for Bob Whitman, who was presenting two theater pieces at Circle in the Square Theatre [New York]. And that continued through 9 Evenings[: Theatre & Engineering, 1966] until I went to Ottawa for a few months to work on a history of the Russian Revolution. 1967 was the fifty-year anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Somehow I got hired to do research in Canada. I worked for a man named Moses Znaimer, who has gone on to start a local TV station, City TV, and Canada’s version of MTV and has become quite a media mogul. He’d gone to the Russian Institute at Harvard. Somehow, I think through my friend Connie Beezer, the administrative assistant at the Russian Institute at Columbia, I heard about his project, contacted him and was hired to do research for this multi- part series on the Russian Revolution and the Soviet Union, called Revolution Plus Fifty. I moved to Ottawa for that time period, the winter of 1966 into spring 1967. I remember that the last program in the series was to be an interview with Marshall McLuhan about possible futures for the Soviet Union that I regretfully had to miss, as I came back to New York to work on a show at CBS, a locally produced cultural program series called Eye on New York. The show I worked on was about the new art and was called “The Walls Come Tumbling Down” [1967].
 The executive producer was Merrill Brockway, who went on to PBS to be the great long-time director of the series Dance in America. The show did segments on Tony Smith, Marta Minujín, who was working with E.A.T. [Experiments in Art & Technology] engineer Per Biorn to make an interactive sculpture—a telephone booth called the Minuphone [1967]—and a segment on Rauschenberg when he was working on the Revolvers [1967].
 We filmed an interview with Bob and filmed the day when the Revolvers were delivered from the fabricator, Treitel-Gratz, and he and Brice Marden, who was his assistant at the time, assembled and saw them in action for the first time. This must have been March or April 1967.
 Then that summer I worked for Christophe de Menil on her performance series, Midsummer. And in the fall I worked several weeks for Channel Thirteen in New York, again doing research for a program on the history of the Russian Revolution. That brings me up to the time I went to work at E.A.T.
 Also, I have to say that at that time there were so many Bobs or Roberts around that we had to find ways to distinguish them: Bob Fagan, Bob Whitman, Bob Rauschenberg, [Robert] Bob Breer. I think I got to saying, “Robert” for Fagan, “Bob R.” for Rauschenberg, and “Whitman” and “Breer” for the other two.",764
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19920,"An interview with Julie Martin: I didn’t know. I think it was the Reuben Gallery [New York]? It’s documented. I can’t remember. [Note: It was at the Reuben Gallery.] But it was a space that they took over and he built those tunnels. The next piece after Whitman’s was Jim Dine’s Car Crash [1960], which I didn’t go to. I remember having the postcard for Car Crash on the wall in the hall of my apartment. But I wasn’t really in that world, but just beginning to be interested and to go to things through Whitman, primarily. Robert and I stayed friends with Simone and Bob and saw them from time to time. Whitman was married to Simone Forti at the time. I saw Whitman’s piece Flower in 1963.
 But I never saw Oldenburg’s series of performances at his Ray Gun Theater in early 1962, nor did I see the dance work going on at Judson [Memorial] Church [New York]. Judson Dance Theater was pretty separate from the performances at the Reuben Gallery, although there was some overlap, with Trisha Brown appearing in Whitman’s pieces, Mouth [1961] and Flower. Bob Rauschenberg was, of course, more involved in the dance performances at Judson Church. I remember Billy telling me that he tried to get Bob to go to one of the performances that were in the East Village—maybe Claes Oldenburg’s—but they turned back before getting there. However, Bob R. and Bob Whitman were friends during this period and it all came together, I think, with Steve Paxton and Alan [R.] Solomon producing the series First New York Theater Rally, in the spring of 1965, where Bob R. did Spring Training [1965] and Pelican [1963] and Bob Whitman did Night Time Sky [1965] and the dancers like Paxton, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Trisha Brown presented works.
 I wasn’t doing very much—going to Columbia and not getting my degree and seeing a lot of art with Robert. After the blackout of November 1965, I began to live full-time at his place in Washington Square Village [New York].",471
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19926,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. When Steve Paxton organized the First New York Theater Rally in the spring of 1965 all three participated. Bob R. did Spring Training; Whitman did Night Time Sky; and Oldenburg did Washes [1965]. So it was probably logical for Brockman to ask the three to participate in a benefit performance night. Most of this is documented so somebody else won’t have trouble finding the details. Whitman did this incredible piece, Prune Flat. Rauschenberg did Map Room II [1965]. Oldenburg did Moveyhouse [1965].",118
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19924,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, I was. But for how I got there I need to go back in time to winter 1965. Bob Whitman did Prune Flat in December of ’65 at a benefit for Jonas Mekas’s Film-Makers’ Cinematheque. It was on Forty-first Street in some basement theater. He remembers it was the Wurlitzer Building with a theater space in the basement on West Forty-first. Whitman says that it was John Brockman, who was trying to do fundraising for Jonas Mekas and the fledgling Film- Makers’ Cinematheque. He went to Whitman and said, “Claes and Bob Rauschenberg are doing it. Will you join?” Then he went to Rauschenberg and said, “Whitman and Oldenburg are doing something.” [Laughter] He sort of got them all to say yes.",191
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19928,An interview with Julie Martin: Steve Paxton was in this one too. This one had Steve and Alex and Deborah Hay. I remember that Deborah did some amazing slow poses on an antique-y couch that was on stage. In another section she was wearing something like a chicken-wire cage around her body that had pigeons in it.,68
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19934,An interview with Julie Martin: Then Rauschenberg and—maybe Steve was in this—but I remember Alex Hay and they were walking on tires. Then they walked into and onto mattress springs that made sounds as they rolled onto it.,48
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19935,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, I never thought of it that way. In some weird ways you follow what your parents did and my mother went to New York after she graduated from Vanderbilt [University, Nashville] and so in some way I had the idea that I would live in New York. I never planned to leave New York, but mainly it was very cheap to live there. After the one- to one-and-a-half years of courses, Columbia was very cheap. I had an apartment at 130 Morningside Drive, $130 per month with four bedrooms and three roommates. So there was no question of leaving New York. I had a boyfriend named Robert Fagan. He’d gone to Princeton [University, New Jersey] and got kicked out for not going to chapel. [Laughter] Can you believe? In those days that could happen. He was living in New York and was sort of an independent art historian. I mean, he studied on his own. He’s a poet and art historian. He was an incredibly exciting, intellectual person. He was the boyfriend of one of my housemates at Radcliffe and we had all met him on some visits. But at Thanksgiving of our senior year in college he had contracted one of the last really bad cases of polio. She stayed with him during his first months in the hospital when he was completely paralyzed. But he survived and began to improve. When I met him again in New York in the fall of 1960 he was in a wheelchair, but that didn’t stop him from going to every art gallery and museum, theater performance, or concert that he wanted to see. So I really got my art education from him. I really learned a lot about art from him. In particular the sense that there’s no difference between old art and new art. That it’s a continuum and that you don’t react against new art because it’s new. You accept it and you see the same qualities in it that you see in the older art.
 But I really didn’t know anything much about contemporary art. I remember going to [Leo] Castelli Gallery [New York] with Robert. There was one of—I always tell this story—one of Roy Lichtenstein’s recent paintings. It was one of his versions of cubist Picasso. And I said, “Oh, when was that Picasso painted?” And Leo said, “That Lichtenstein was painted last week.” Okay. You realize you had something to learn. But I looked at a lot of art then with Robert.
 I also met Robert [“Bob”] Whitman through Robert Fagan. Actually, as early as 1960. Robert had grown up in Englewood, New Jersey. He hadn’t known Whitman. But one of his brothers, Peter Fagan, had been a friend of Bob Whitman and another guy there named Hugh Mitchell. Hugh was studying writing at NYU [New York University] and was part of the crew helping Whitman put on the theater piece, American Moon [1960]. Hugh Mitchell invited Robert and me to the performance and we went. That was the first theater piece or performance I’d ever seen. I had no idea what was going on, but I vividly remember some of the images and the experience of sitting in one of the tunnels facing the main space and seeing Bob and Simone [Forti] rolling over each other and then hopping, lying down around the space, the sounds from above, the clear plastic shape that filled the center space.",742
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19942,"An interview with Julie Martin: I went to this show. I had finished my thesis at Columbia in the fall of 1965 and thus had graduated there that semester. I was just hanging around doing nothing, or looking for a job.
 Whitman repeated Prune Flat at the Martinique Theatre, a theater in the Martinique Hotel near Thirty-fourth Street in the spring and then Paul Libin, the owner of Circle in the Square Theatre, offered Whitman the theater for the whole summer of 1966. Whitman put on two pieces every weekend, two days a weekend, Friday and Saturday: Prune Flat and a piece called Untitled.
 I was what would pass for a stage manager or assistant. I ran the projectors for Prune Flat, which meant I had to block off—rather than project—sections of the back film. So the film going on the girl would be clear and wouldn’t get mixed up with the film going on the back. That was my job. Also I swept up the broken glass from the broken light bulb to clear the stage for the second piece. For the piece, Untitled, Steve Paxton was in it and he wore a white suit. The last image was different puffs of colored smoke coming out of different parts of the suit. Bob had tubes running from backstage to different holes cut in the suit jacket. My job was to pack the tubes in the suit with colored powder. I would put a bit of Kleenex in the tube to hold the powder at the end, push it down the tube a little and then pour the powder into the end of the tube. You can’t imagine how much white shoe polish I used on the suit when I would spill the powder trying to get it into the tube. Also I had to clean it every week.",365
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19946,"An interview with Julie Martin: He would blow into each tube. This would dislodge the little piece of Kleenex and the powder would come out in a cloud of color. This is what I did. As I said, we performed the two pieces each weekend.
 That was the same summer that Christophe de Menil did Midsummer in August, where she invited artists to perform at different places near her home in the Hamptons [New York]. I remember she invited Twyla Tharp and dancers and showed Tony Conrad’s recently completed film, The Flicker [1965]. Bob Whitman did a piece called Two Holes of Water [1966]. I worked on that. I helped him with that. He asked me to find 16-millimeter films for him. One image he specifically asked for was penguins. My great triumph was to find a film on penguins that he wanted. A lot of documentaries made for schools were being de-accessioned for some reason. There was a place on Fifty-seventh Street where you could buy 16-millimeter films for not very much.",226
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19954,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, nothing that formal. I’m sure he asked me to do things or I offered to help. But I don’t know whether he was getting paid. I don’t remember getting paid for it. [Laughs] Well, at that point in my life I had a family. I had my mother and father who would help out. Or maybe I still had some money.",88
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19955,"An interview with Julie Martin: In those days, not really. I remember Bob and Simone would come to dinner at Robert’s. We just kind of stayed friends. I was sort of around. I wasn’t doing anything. I was interested.
 Nobody hired anybody in those days.",61
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19952,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, 9 Evenings. It became a completely different piece. When Bob [Whitman] looked at the armory space, he got the idea to use the cars. The military was still parking vehicles on the armory floor. You see them parked outside the armory on Lexington Avenue in some of the photos of the opening night. He had seven cars, each carrying either film or television projectors, drive out onto the armory floor and park facing the back wall that was covered with white paper. On the balcony, television cameras shot live performances: two girls moving slowly in front of a curved mirror, a girl typing, a small fiber optic camera inside a coat pocket. Whitman fed images of these live performances and off-air television images to the television projectors in the cars. He also cued the drivers to turn on the films of nature subjects like the eagles and the penguins.",188
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19958,"An interview with Julie Martin: It took place in a swamp on Two Holes of Water Road [Easthampton, New York], which gave Bob the title. And at the bottom of a hill off this road were two holes of water. One of the first things, as the audience members walked from the road down the hill, he had paper bags each with sand and a candle in it, lining the pathway. People walked down and then at the “entrance” of the area, where the performance would take place, they walked between two screens. Steve Paxton and I were over to the left of the screens in a swampy muddy piece of land and I had a video camera and he had a light. He was lighting his feet and he was walking in this swampy terrain and the video image of his feet was projected on the screens and I was videotaping it and the people saw that image. The audience sat facing the body of water and Bob had film images and things going on in the woods beyond the pond, people in a boat on the pond. Bob had other film images and things going on with the water, with the water for this and more activity that had to do with the outdoors and the sound that went with the outdoors. The engineers who were working on 9 Evenings helped him with some of the technical aspects of the video, sound, and film projection—how to get power into this fairly remote swampy area.
 I was still working with him when he did the piece again and called it Two Holes of Water-2 [1966] at the New York Film Festival in September. He adapted the original piece to the new space he was working in, as he did when he did it in 9 Evenings. The second performance was held in the basement of the Lincoln Center library [New York Public Library for the Performing Arts] where there’s a little bitty theater. Maybe it’s not there anymore but it was a tiny theater. I think it was mainly for films and the space on stage was almost non-existent. Bob used elements and images from the performance on Long Island. As I remember, it began with images of people coming into the theater projected on the walls of the theater. The other images appeared and I remember that it was an amazing experience, the timing and the images. Everything was working together. But that evening there was one of those torrential rainstorms in New York.
 The water was flooding into this theater, which was below ground and water was rising. When it got near the electricity, Bob had to stop the piece. I remember being completely disappointed that the piece, which was so moving, had to be stopped. We were flooded out. Then he did the same piece for 9 Evenings, calling it Two Holes of Water-3 [1966].",578
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19956,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right, Bob and Alex worked with tires in Pelican. Steve and Alex were in Map Room II. This was the piece where Bob stepped into—or, better, onto—shoes made by Arman [born Armand Fernandez], which were shoes embedded in clear acrylic blocks glued together to make kind of high platform shoes. Then he reached down and picked up these two neon tubes that started glowing as he held them in his hands, activated by what the catalogue says were “contact sensors.” He walked across the stage holding these glowing neon tubes. I think it was an extraordinarily beautiful piece. I remember him saying that he had to grab the neon tubes firmly or he could get an electric shock.
 I do remember something that happened at the party after the performances at the Forty-first Street Theater in December that year. I suppose as part of the benefit there was a party for the artists, performers, and audience. It was in a room next to the theater. I remember Claes and [Patricia] Patty [Mucha, née Muschinski] doing a series of improvised tableaux on the stage, opening and closing the curtain, each time revealing a different pose. Then at one point Bob R. had Simone in a cloth bag and he was carrying her on his shoulder walking around the party and she was singing inside the sack. And it was this exact thing that he added to the second performance of his 9 Evenings piece, Open Score [1966]. He had her in a cloth sack and picked her up and carried her to different parts of the [69th Regiment] Armory floor and put her down for a time before picking her up and moving her to another part of the space and all the time she was singing a Tuscan love song. It was gorgeous.
 Whitman did Prune Flat there [Forty-first Street Theater]. It is one of his classic pieces. It was a film piece, where a film of images fills the back wall of the stage and two performers [Simone Forti and Lucinda Childs] come on stage moving and slowly sometimes interacting with the images on the wall. Then the third performer [Mimi Stark] comes out and stands and a second film is projected on her of her and her clothes as they change colors or style instantaneously. She follows the actions in the film as she walks across the stage, smokes a cigarette, undresses, and the film continues to be projected on her. It’s about what film can do. You couldn’t do that if you couldn’t do film. Then he has things happening in the film and then they happen on stage. For instance, there is the film of an empty street on Wall Street and the two performers walk around the corner and across the street. Then a bit later the same two performers wearing the same coats walk across the stage. At the end of the piece, action on stage follows a film of it—a bright light bulb goes on high above the two performers’ heads, is pulled down by Lucinda, and Simone throws water from a glass at it and it breaks. Simone was amazing—if the water didn’t break the bulb she would just reach out and hit it with the glass to break it. It’s an extraordinary piece.",678
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19957,Q: Maybe I can ask you to go back and to talk about that initial period working with Robert Whitman and just give me a sense of what it was like to work with him? What was he like? What’s his personality like? And what were his working methods like? So you’re introduced to this world.,68
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19967,"Q: —but for Two Holes of Water, you were saying you had found the film. Did he say, “Go out and find something,” and just go with whatever you brought him?",43
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q19970,"An interview with Julie Martin: Simone and Lucinda Childs. And the third performer was Mimi Stark, who worked a lot with Bob in those days. So, with Whitman, it was very straightforward. There was no—what do you call it—expertise? When a ballerina has what?",64

Then he went to Steuben Glass [Works] and was working for [Arthur A.] Houghton [Jr.]. He was an arts administrator. But he just wasn’t quite rigorous enough for what Billy had in mind. I think that Billy’s interest was in collaborating with artists. He really wasn’t interested in going back to Bell Labs.",102
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20175,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. The artists were ready. I mean, they had questions and projects. The first efforts of E.A.T. were to attract engineers. And also the idea of industrially-sponsored collaboration was an idea which we pursued—to have artists-in-residence or have industry take responsibility for supporting collaborations in their area. But most important was to attract engineers.",83
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20183,"An interview with Julie Martin: We got a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts [NYSCA]. It was one of the first grants. John [B.] Hightower, who was Executive Director of NYSCA—who just died recently—was a fan. In those days, apparently it was really easy to apply for grants because we got one. We also got a grant from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.",87
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20181,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, there was no idea of paying for this service. It might have been a good idea from a fundraising point of view but Billy and Bob wanted E.A.T. to be open and reach as many artists as possible. You didn’t want to have the artist pay for something. But there’s something really funny in an early newsletter. In one of them Billy wrote, “If you want to join, please fill out the artist membership form. Names written on little slips of paper aren’t useful.” [Laughter] The idea was that people became members. They would sign up and the artists would become members. Engineers would sign up and become members as well. The engineers were encouraged to become members and on their membership form to give information on their technical field and their interest in working with artists. Then any member could, of course, ask any question they wanted. The effort in the beginning was to attract engineers. That the artists were interested was shown at the first E.A.T. meeting that they held on November 30th where they had a panel of artists and engineers who’d worked on 9 Evenings. They had made a general invitation to the art world and something like three hundred people showed up. You’ve probably seen that photo.",273
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20186,"An interview with Julie Martin: It attracted engineers and began to make publicity for this idea. By the summer of 1968, we received so many applications and works of art to the competition, more than 160 works, that once Pontus had chosen the few works he wanted for his show at MoMA, we decided to show all the submitted works at the same time. We approached the Brooklyn Museum and they had space available—this would never be possible today. Bob showed Oracle at MoMA. He didn’t have a work at Brooklyn but he came up with the title of the exhibition, Some More Beginnings[: Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), 1968–69], and helped Billy and me come up with the idea of a completely non-hierarchical catalogue. We printed it on a huge web press in Denville, New Jersey. In those days they made screened images called veloxes that were used on the printing plate so we had two veloxes of each work made, one with the art-type information as a caption and the other grayed down with the technical information about the work superimposed on the image. Then Billy and I laid all these veloxes out on a long roll of paper at the printers and cut every 11 inches (the width of the page). Some artists were upset when the image of their piece was cut in half, but every work was treated the same and it was non-hierarchical.",301
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20187,"An interview with Julie Martin: We were never really that [well-]funded. I remember that the Rockefeller Brothers Fund turned E.A.T. down for a second grant because we served all artists who came to us. They thought we should be more selective. Another fundraising thing we tried to do was industrial memberships, so we got some money from that.",74
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20184,Q: That was right at the beginning. I think I saw something in the E.A.T. catalogue that was in that period. It would have gone much further than it would have today. It was on the order of eight thousand dollars or something like that. It was a relatively modest grant.,62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20191,"An interview with Julie Martin: They would become a member for maybe a thousand dollars a year. I think we tried that. We also tried to have a membership campaign for individuals and the only person who responded and became a member was Dr. Frank Stanton from CBS. I remember that Billy did fundraising to specifically raise the money to pay the prize for the engineers in the E.A.T. competition. The Brooklyn show was put together with a lot of volunteer work from the artists and engineers involved. I think just at the time when things were getting rough, during the time of the Brooklyn show, the Pepsi project came along and they gave us some money to develop a proposal. Then the next two years were funded a lot by working on the Pepsi Pavilion. But we were doing a lot of other projects and activities besides.",165
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20188,"Q: That’s one thing I was wondering. That was also in the book about the Pompidou Center in Paris. I was just looking at that and it was reminding me that E.A.T. was asked to design this screen that was going to go on the outside of the Pompidou Center. It made me wonder—the Pepsi Pavilion too—whether E.A.T. was not just a kind of clearinghouse, putting X in contact with Y—artists and engineers in touch—but was actually an organization looking for work. That makes it sound like E.A.T. was getting a commission to develop a screen.",137
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20189,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, open houses were one way. Billy gave talks at universities and colleges. We visited industrial laboratories like IBM and several places like that. We generated write-ups in technical magazines. We began a lecture series on various aspects of technology for artists and invited engineers and scientists from many different places to lecture. I think Billy loosely had in mind that E.A.T. could function like a professional engineering society, like the IEEE [Institute for Electric and Electronic Engineers] with a membership and chapters. He did try to have the IEEE organize a technical specialty subgroup, Engineering in Art, but they never did it. One thing I have to add is that there was an immediate response to the idea of E.A.T. as an organization to help artist and engineers to work together from all over the United States and all over the world. It seemed to be an idea whose time had come. Billy and Bob got requests from friends in other places asking if they could open E.A.T. groups in their cities. They said yes immediately and, within two years, about twenty E.A.T. local groups were active, run by local artists and engineers and pretty much independent of us.
 To go back to the pursuit of engineers, in the spring 1968 came a new opportunity to attract engineers. Pontus Hultén had been invited to make an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age [1968–69], that began with Leonardo [da Vinci] and went into the present. Pontus asked Billy and E.A.T. to find new works— contemporary works—that incorporated technology. Billy saw this as an opportunity to attract engineers. E.A.T. sponsored a competition in which the prize would go to the engineer for “the best contribution by an engineer to a work of art made in collaboration with an artist.” The competition was announced in the New York Times [November 12, 1967] and several of the technical journals. Part of the announcement was that Pontus would choose works for his Machine show from the works submitted. Also E.A.T. offered to match up artists and engineers to work on projects if they wanted to.",461
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20195,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, the names are there. The cards with the names of the engineers on them and on the back are names of artists who were given the engineer’s name. It’s a primitive record of who was matched with whom, so maybe one could follow up with the engineers and the artists. The cards are all at the Getty Research Institute [Los Angeles].
 In the early seventies we were updating the matching system. First we designed and printed a more complete and detailed edge-notched card for the McBee System that would have allowed us to keep better track of the matches. We also started to develop a computer database of artists and engineers so they could get in touch with each other that we called EATEX.",155
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20197,"An interview with Julie Martin: The feasibility study for the outdoor screen for Centre Pompidou was much later— 1975–76. And, like several of the E.A.T. projects over the years, it developed out of a dialogue between Billy and Pontus. Pontus, in about 1973, had gone to Paris to develop the Musée National d’Art Moderne for the Centre Georges Pompidou. One of the ideas of the architects— Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers, who won the competition for the building—was to have a video screen on the outside of the building with varied programming on it. Pontus asked Billy to develop a proposal and feasibility study for such a screen and programming for it: games people could play from kiosks on the plaza, views of what was going on in the museum, films by or about artists, et cetera. So Billy, operating within E.A.T., enlisted the necessary technical people and industries to make a feasibility study for developing and installing such a screen. He worked with main sub-contractor, Ford Aeronautics, to develop the proposal. But because the French bureaucracy wanted a fixed price for the system—not the usual cost-plus formula American companies were used to—the cost submitted was very high and the system was never built, and we never got to the point of developing programming for it. But E.A.T. was never “looking for work” in the sense you ask. We applied for grants and wrote a lot of proposals for funding.
 Let me back up. E.A.T.’s most active years were 1966 to 1973 or ’74. During this period there developed two tracks of E.A.T. activities. The first was what we called the Artists Matching Program, where artists could write or come to E.A.T. with technical questions, problems, or requests for help in developing an idea that needed one aspect of new technology or another— electrical, mechanical, or chemical engineering and beyond—and E.A.T. would match the artist with an engineer in the appropriate field, who could help with the project. It started with Billy and Fred Waldhauer handling the matches, then Ralph Flynn and then, for several years, Peter Poole was in charge of matchings. It was for this program that we made the effort to sign up engineers from all over the country and from many different fields. This program continued throughout the major years of E.A.T. activities. It was for this matching system that we developed lists of engineers who could help artists and explored different method of information retrieval. We had artist members, but we never wanted to have a database of artists.
 The first information retrieval system we developed was for matchings—to be able to access engineers. As we had more and more engineers sign up, we needed to be able to find them. This system used McBee Keysort cards. I don’t know if you know the cards with the knitting needles? Knitting needles. That was how Peter was working. Names, addresses, and specialties of the engineers were on cards. Then the holes around the edge of the card were assigned different information: city, specialties, et cetera. We only made these cards for engineers. Then when the artist had a question, you stuck the needles through the corresponding holes and the engineer with the selected specialty and right location would fall out. Peter would then give the artist the names and addresses of the engineers. He would write the artist’s name on the back of the card. But that was the extent of our follow-up. Because we didn’t follow up these matches. We just sort of sent people out into the world together.",777
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20203,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, I don’t know. I shouldn’t say that. I don’t want to say that. But actually, he resigned as chairman at one point during this time—early seventies. I think just other things were pressing on him. Maybe this is when he moved to Florida. I don’t know exactly when but sometime about this time. He just felt he couldn’t fulfill the obligations of being chairman.",99
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20200,"An interview with Julie Martin: We were working on it with Honeywell Bull and even made a prototype. We applied to the Ford Foundation for funding for the Artists Matching Program [Matching Artist and Engineer Service, 1966]—a very elaborate proposal with provisions for following up and collecting information on the collaborations—but we were turned down. Even after the mid-seventies when funding became scarce and E.A.T. downsized, so to speak, Billy would answer any artist who called and find technical help for him/her.
 In addition to that ongoing matching program we found ourselves initiating and administering larger scale projects. The first was the E.A.T. competition and the Some More Beginnings show at the Brooklyn Museum in 1968. The next was the Pepsi Pavilion. These large projects came along almost by chance, literally. The Pepsi Pavilion came about when Robert Breer’s neighbor in Snedens Landing [New York], David Thomas, who worked for PepsiCo International, said, “Pepsi has the opportunity to do this pavilion for Expo ’70 in Osaka, Japan, one of three American companies allowed to have pavilions. It can’t be commercial. The theme is toward the future. Art and technology. Are you interested?” Breer, of course, wanted to have his Floats up there at the pavilion. He came to Billy and said, “Are you interested?” Billy saw this is as a great opportunity for artists’ and engineers’ collaborations. It wasn’t looking for work. It came. It was an opportunity. Let’s do it. It just so happened that that money was very useful at the time.
 Then, from ’69 to ’70, although we were engulfed, in a way, by the pavilion, a lot of other things happened. 1969 was the same year that we developed this idea of Projects Outside Art, which I say is the less sexy part of E.A.T. but is a direction that interests people now. The next generation has gotten to it. It was that forward-looking. I think that was very much Billy and Bob Whitman working together because Bob Whitman was part of the Pepsi Pavilion project and became more active in E.A.T. on a day-to-day basis.
 Rauschenberg hadn’t really wanted to be part of the pavilion. He gave some suggestions in the beginning and sat in on some meetings but his interest was not in being part of making a pavilion for Expo ’70.",535
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20201,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, we never did it. I’ve more recently realized why we weren’t involved. Vikram died, quite young, in 1971. Actually in ’74–75 the ATS-F satellite was sent over India and the group initiated what they called SITE [Satellite Instructional Television Experiment] project, led by Dr. [E. V.] Chitnis, who had been part of the group working with us, using satellite transmission for direct broadcast of educational programming, which used some of these ideas we proposed. We didn’t do it, but it did take fruit. There’s a young man named Alexander Keefe, who writes about art and art in Asia. He’s researching the SITE project, interviewing people, and working on this issue.
 This idea of Projects Outside Art was kind of born with the Anand project—that this would be a really interesting way to go for the kinds of projects that E.A.T. would initiate, would push things further. Of course, looking back, the pavilion’s one of them. You’re not making art. You’re making a pavilion for a world’s fair. It is a kind of Project Outside Art. The concept developed. We got some sort of grant to do a series of exhibitions and so we asked for suggestions for Project Outside Art. One we did was [A Vegetable Roof Gardening Project] City Agriculture [1970] or rooftop gardening with the University of Arizona to do hydroponic gardening on city rooftops. Another was Children and Communication [1970] in which we had these two areas connected by telephone lines and different terminals—telex, telephone, facsimile machines, Electrowriter—in which the kids could use the equipment freely to communicate with each other. It was a test project to have kids communicate with other areas of the city without having to go out of their own neighborhoods. Interestingly enough, we did this the first year of the internet, 1971. But of course, we had no idea. At that point, Billy wasn’t part of the technical community that was following this stuff so it came out of ideas he and Whitman and E.A.T. staff developed. E.A.T. L.A. [Los Angeles] developed some ideas around Recreation and Play [1970].",494
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20204,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, Projects Outside Art. Well, the pavilion became one of them, when you look back on it. I don’t know if they were thinking that but we began to develop the idea that the artist, as a professional with certain skills—not art skills, but certain skills, human skills—could be part of an interdisciplinary team that could work in other areas of society on other problems. This also partly came about because of Vikram Sarabhai, who was head of the Atomic Energy Commission in India. The Sarabhais—they’re a very wealthy Indian family based in Ahmedabad, [who acquired their wealth through] mainly textiles and then pharmaceuticals.
 There were many brothers. Vikram was a scientist—quite a well-known scientist—active with Pugwash [Conferences on Science and World Affairs], anti-nuclear weapons and pro-peaceful uses of atomic energy. He was head of the Atomic Energy Commission in India and initiated their space program. NASA had offered India the opportunity to get an ATS-F [Applications Technology Satellite] communications satellite over India so that you could broadcast directly to the villages. In other words, you didn’t have to build this infrastructure going out from Delhi slowly, telephone poles or wires, whatever. He saw this as a great opportunity.
 He asked E.A.T. to help develop instructional software or develop methods for developing software. This was in the winter of ’69. We put together a group of people of whom an artist was part—Whitman was the artist—to go to India and work on this issue. Fred Waldhauer and [Ernst] Ernie Rothkopf, who was an education specialist at Bell Labs. Somebody from Xerox teaching. Fred Waldhauer and Peter Poole, who was an E.A.T. staff member. And I went. This group was going to work with their Indian counterparts. They actually did come up with an idea using 1/2-inch video to make visual research notes as a basis for developing educational programs to be broadcast by satellite.
 Our target area for a test project was the Amul Dairy Cooperative in Anand in Gujarat state, where Ahmedabad is, the center of which was a big, modern dairy that supplies milk and milk products to Bombay. There were like fifteen hundred women every day, who would bring small quantities of milk from their buffalo twice a day to collection stations in or near their villages. They would weigh it and test the fat content, pay the women for the milk, and then it would go to the dairy. They had this incredible distribution system. The idea would be to use 1/2-inch video in the villages, make tapes that the people there even could be involved in making. Then you could circulate them using the milk collection system and do your testing ahead of time so you knew what kind of images, what kind of teaching worked. Then you’d go and make the tapes for broadcast, rather than have somebody from the BBC sit and lecture the farmers.",634
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20205,"Q: One thing I was going to ask you before I forget. I don’t think it was ever published, but in this period leading up to E.A.T., I think around 1965, Billy had a project of writing a book that was going to be called “Art and Engineering.” What happened to that?",70
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20211,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, it was really early. I know in one of the first newsletters I did, we list fifteen or twenty. We had a local groups conference in 1968 where we brought people who were interested in organizing E.A.T. groups together to give them the benefit of our wisdom [Laughter] We didn’t try to set up any kind of structure, which we could have. That could have been something else—to have had a national organization with chapters. Billy’s idea of an organization was a little bit based on IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, where you have a national organization and then you have local chapters that do kind of local things.",144
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20208,"An interview with Julie Martin: But any time Billy had any questions, he would always go to Bob. He absolutely trusted Bob’s take on things—his kind of decisions, his insight. He would go and say, “We’re thinking about doing this. What about it?” I mean, I can’t think specifically right now. But I know that there would be meetings where we were starting something. Billy would go and talk to Bob about it. Or if there was a question about something, he would go and talk to Bob about it. When we started the New York Collection for Stockholm project in 1971, Bob was very involved in it from the beginning. Pontus had chosen a beautiful cardboard piece for the collection and then Bob supported Billy’s idea to have Teledyne [Thousand Oaks, California] donate Mud Muse [1968–71] to the collection. The collection was originally a fundraising idea for E.A.T. that Bob Whitman discovered, in which the government used [U.S.] Treasury Funds to match donations to the government of property or other things of value. The collection was to go to an American museum and E.A.T. would get a grant through the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] Treasury Fund project. That didn’t work out and Pontus, having chosen the collection, asked that it go to Moderna Museet. Bob, Bob Whitman and the other artists agreed, as Pontus and Moderna Museet had been the first museum to show their generation of American artists in Europe. We had agreed to pay the artists what they would normally receive for their work and the dealers agreed to forego their commission so their commission would go to E.A.T. When it became clear that fundraising for getting the collection to Sweden was going to be difficult, we sat down with Bob and came up with the idea of each artist contributing a print to a portfolio that could be sold to raise money. Bob brought in Adi Rischner at Styria Studio [New York], whom he’d worked with on the Currents series [1970], to do the printing.",444
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20212,"An interview with Julie Martin: —efficient way to spread the idea of artists and engineers working together. I should also say, the other thing about E.A.T.— You said, “How did you find the engineers?” There was an extraordinary response all over the country. People in different places either who knew Bob or knew Billy—or didn’t know them at all—loved the idea. They would say, “Can we start E.A.T. chapters?” We’d say, “Yes.” So in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, friends began to start these chapters that began to do their own activities, attracting local engineers and local artists.",146
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20213,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. He has said that he realized that to make art and engineering effective, it needed to be a bigger effort than just him, or him and his colleagues at Bell Labs. How do you do that? He thought of writing a book. He began to ask artists to make proposals. Maybe make the proposals the basis of the book to interest engineers, or to make the idea—say, here are these artists that want to do these amazing things. I know there’s a letter from [John] Cage and there’s a letter from [Nam June] Paik answering him. This was like late ’65, I think. And then about that time, Knut Wiggen came from Sweden and said, “Are you interested in participating in this festival of art and technology I am organizing?” They got involved in that and then that took its own path to the 9 Evenings. Then the idea of an organization came up and that seemed to be a much—",210
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20223,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think so. It seemed nobody understood about it. Maybe to people in the field it just was too different.

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20226,"An interview with Julie Martin: So that’s where people you knew lived— [Laughter] —to be perfectly honest. You knew that they got the idea and they wanted to do something with it. We did try to encourage the groups. I remember going to Seattle and Portland [Oregon] and meeting with the people who wanted to have E.A.T. groups there and the woman in Berkeley [California]. Billy met with the people who were interested—like David MacDermott and Ardison Phillips already had a group of people they were working with and then they formed the E.A.T. L.A. group when we first started doing the pavilion because so much of the technology and industries were out there. David and Ardison and some young architects were very involved in aspects of the pavilion, in particular the air-structure mirror. But that chapter of E.A.T. remained very active for several years. E.A.T. Japan started when we started going to Japan for the pavilion, in January of ’69. It was quite active. Fujiko [Nakaya] did a great job administering it and doing it. At that moment, there was a real response to this concept of art and technology and artists and engineers and scientists working together.",267
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20224,Q: When artists and engineers were coming together—because this is also the era in which government support and foundation support of the arts is really blossoming. Was your sense that these projects—or was your instruction to them—were they going out and writing grants? Here’s an artist: “I’ve found my engineer and I want to apply for support to put on a big show I’m going to put together next fall. We’ll write a grant application together.” Were they trying to do that?,112
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20230,An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. It was having ideas and kind of exploring them and moving with the ideas probably too far ahead of what was feasible. The organization never went away. It actually still exists.,42
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20228,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think so. Like administrative assistant. On projects, project assistant, I would think. Whatever was needed. It’s hard to say. Then, of course, after 1974, E.A.T. became less and less active. The problem was in terms of funding. If you look at a lot of the proposals we made in the early seventies, we were trying to straddle the professions. We didn’t have long experience in education or in technology development for underdeveloped countries. You just didn’t have the—what do you call it—roots. We didn’t have the reputation or roots in the structures of other institutions in the society. You weren’t part of the establishments. Some people caught on and worked with us, on Children and Communication or City Agriculture, for example. But to try to bridge that gap in terms of funding or getting people in different institutional structures to try new approaches—to let the artist in, so to speak—it didn’t seem to work. We have a lot of proposals that we made then that look great now but it was too soon. I think it was just too soon. But it would probably be too soon now, even.",257
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20233,An interview with Julie Martin: Well—[Laughter] When I say it is. You know something’s E.A.T. when—I just say it’s E.A.T. We don’t raise money. But it hasn’t disappeared. It’s still a good sort of a concept.,73
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20239,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. And in the early days of E.A.T., it was still pretty informal grant-giving. I remember we got a grant from the JDR [John D. Rockefeller] 3rd Fund to send artists to India. I think Billy called Porter [A.] McCray or met with him and said that, up to now, they had invited Asian artists to come to New York and Billy suggested sending American artists to India. There was informality, even with the New York State Council. We didn’t get involved in funding artist projects. Maybe if there had been a huge demand for it that might have been something E.A.T. could have done. There was no sense about fiscal sponsors even. You know? So those concepts weren’t there—those fundraising concepts. We did try to do some artists-in-residence, and with some success. We sort of never did anything twice—like a yearly exhibition of art and technology, or continuing courses on technology for artists—which doesn’t help in terms of longevity.",224

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20250,"An interview with Julie Martin: I don’t think so. We didn’t find support for individual artist’s and engineer’s projects. In the beginning, in the early issues of the newsletter, there was emphasis on industrial support of these collaborations and the need for industry to be part of the picture. We did try to do some of this—in particular, set up possibilities for artists to work within industries—the Singer Corporation and a residency agreement with the Amalgamated Lithographers Union to have artists working their experimental workshop. But I think the artists’ projects and requests were too varied for E.A.T. to be able to go to the appropriate industry for each of them. It evolved for the individual engineer to work with the artist and possibly be the carrier of the project to his business.
 The model of directly placing artists within certain industries was carried out by Maurice Tuchman at LACMA [Los Angeles County Museum of Art], in his Art and Technology exhibition project. He chose well-known artists and matched them up with participating industries in the L.A. area and hoped for a work to emerge that he could show. There’s a great catalogue that follows each artist-industry project and you can see some successes that resulted in beautiful works. Rauschenberg’s Mud Muse at Teledyne came out of this program. But his goal was only to produce works for an exhibition and once the exhibition was over in 1971, there was no follow-up. [Note: Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Art and Technology, May 10– Aug. 29, 1971. Exh. cat.

 Maybe E.A.T.’s not raising money for individual artworks comes from the idea that we were not in the art-making business. We were in the social revolution business. Of course, before E.A.T. started, Billy worked with individual artists.",424

We’re just scanning the stations. But to Bob, somehow, he knew the noise between stations was something he wanted—something he liked. It was an aesthetic decision as opposed to a purely technical one. When Billy was working with artists, he would try not to take anything for granted in that sense. He would understand that this is something the artist could decide or should decide. Even if they didn’t care, he asked them. I know there was a situation when we were working on the pavilion, where the engineer interfered with aesthetic decisions. David Tudor was working with an engineer called Larry Owens, who really didn’t understand him.
 David always wanted more possibilities, more channels. I mean, the more you could get, the better. They were designing and building the sound modulation system for the sound in the pavilion. There were thirty-seven speakers arranged across the roof of the dome and David wanted as many sound input channels as he could get. But Larry said, “You don’t need more than eight channel inputs.” So here was an engineer making an aesthetic decision, which to him was just an engineering decision. As I say, Billy didn’t know about it. He wasn’t aware of this. Billy always felt bad about this—that David didn’t get as many channels as he would have liked.",317

There is Billy’s story about the red batteries and he was so worried—the car batteries to power Oracle— and all he had was red ones from Bell Labs and Bob didn’t care.",122

I can’t see beyond this impression of somebody who was extraordinarily smart and just so right on about things. Right on about not letting you get away with any kind of bullshit. A kind of incredibly moral sense of decisions, you know? And calling people on it. Calling you on—keeping you straight somehow. You’d always be kind of surprised. He’d say something—you’d be kind of surprised, you know? It would make you think. This ability to make you think.
 I worked with him on one thing, a set of proposals for cultural activities. It’s in Techne where we published what he had written—his ideas about what to do for cultural activities in New York.
 He came up with these wonderful suggestions. I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but I can show it to you. What could be done with people—with cultural activities in New York neighborhoods. He said, “You can’t bring culture to people. You can only bring it out of them.” I mean, in the sense of their own culture. That was an amazing experience to work with him on compiling ideas and suggestions.

 Larry Owens, who worked on the control console for the Pepsi Pavilion, was very much an engineer who didn’t understand and didn’t respect the needs of the artist. He didn’t try. He worked with Fred and David Tudor on the sound system and when David asked for more channels he would could come back to him and say, “Look, all the system will hold is eight.” For Billy and Fred, you don’t say eight is enough if the artist is saying, “Can we get more?” Or, “Can I have more?” So it’s about stretching yourself.",202
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20074,"An interview with Julie Martin: They weren’t. But, that said, the culture at Bell Labs was certainly that the level of members of technical staff, like Billy—the researchers—came and went as they wanted and could choose to work on things that they wanted. There was a great amount of latitude and freedom and the researchers could give their TAs, or technical assistants, jobs to do. Later, Billy, in the 1990s, asked John [R.] Pierce, who was his supervisor and head of the department, “You saw that this was taking time away. Why did you let it happen?” And Pierce said, “Well, it was such a positive experience for these guys that to have stopped it would be a very negative thing.” The negative fallout would be—so there was kind of enlightened leadership at the Labs.
 Although they didn’t officially sponsor the 9 Evenings, John Pierce and others at that level understood that this was a positive experience.",206
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20075,"Q: The way he narrates it in the pieces I’ve seen is that Rauschenberg was in the habit of dropping in to see how their work on the Homage to New York, which they were building in the in the garden of MoMA, [was progressing]. My impression from the way he wrote it was that Rauschenberg knew Tinguely and so came by to see their work on this thing and then met the guy who was the engineer who was helping him.",103
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20072,"An interview with Julie Martin: He says that he may have met Tinguely in Paris. Billy graduated from Kungliga Tekniska högskolan in Stockholm and then he spent a year as a technical assistant, stagiaire, with Thomson-Houston [Electric Company] in Paris. 1952–53 he spent in Paris. Pontus may have come to Paris during that period. Tinguely was part of the group at the Denise René gallery [Paris]. I think Pontus knew Tinguely or got to know Tinguely. Billy says he met Tinguely and Pontus introduced him in Paris as the “man who made anti-television sets.” It might not have been that year but, somehow—because Pontus worked to do the show, Le Mouvement, in ’55 with Denise René. Also it was during this time that Pontus invited Tinguely to Sweden. It was Pontus who wrote Billy in late 1959 and said, “Tinguely’s coming to New York. He has a project. Could you help him?”",237
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20073,"An interview with Julie Martin: To the Student Film Society. Billy, as he said, walked across town from the engineering school to the humanities faculty to join the Student Film Society. Pontus and also the artist, Öyvind [A. C.] Fahlström, were members. The Film Society was one of the non-communist, radical, or progressive groups in Stockholm at the time—the films they showed and the programs they did. That’s how Pontus and Billy met.",104
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20076,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. There’s a David Gahr photo of Bob and Billy talking. They’re in the background and Jean’s in the foreground and you sort of see them talking. So, exactly.",51
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20082,"Q: And the way he narrates it, it makes it sound like it’s just a happenstance. He’s sitting there working with Tinguely and Rauschenberg comes in.",45
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20084,"Q: And because they do write—there’s also the collaborative memory piece—they write a lot about their early work together. I feel like if there had been an origin story—that we met in the gallery, or we met in a coffee shop—that they would have told it in one of those pieces.

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20091,"An interview with Julie Martin: I’m trying to think. Billy’s contribution to Tinguely’s piece was the timing pieces. Billy said Jean had said that it really changed his work. He started doing bigger pieces and not necessarily technical pieces. That was a contribution—that it could be done automatically, not just mechanically. But that you could have events triggered over time was probably Billy’s contribution to the collaboration. Although he was active in getting the requested bicycle wheels—taking Tinguely to the Newark [New Jersey] dump and buying other equipment and chemicals that Jean requested.",126
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20092,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. Exactly. Billy met Jean at the Staempfli show. Jean had a show at Staempfli Gallery [New York], of his Méta-matic drawing machines. Pontus came to New York in September of ’59. He didn’t really know anybody. I know he knew [Samuel L.] Sam Francis and so he met Sam Francis and Sam Francis was living in the same building and on the same floor as Alfred Leslie. Leslie was just finishing up making the film Pull My Daisy [1959]. So they all met each other. Billy talks about walking through Washington Square Park and seeing a poster for 18 Happenings in 6 Parts and saying, “What’s this ridiculous thing?” He and Pontus never went. But recently I found a list of people who had tickets to Kaprow’s piece and Pontus is on the list.
 Now whether he went or not, who knows? So it’s one of these strange things. Whether Billy met Bob at the Staempfli Gallery, whether Bob was at the opening—it’s highly likely—but who knows? I never asked Billy how he met Bob. I could shoot myself. Recently, I realized I never said, “When did you meet Bob?” I’m assuming that it was at this time. Somehow Bob knew Jean and, again, I wasn’t quite sure how.
 But recently, Melissa Rachleff Burtt, who is researching a show on artists-run galleries for NYU Grey [Art] Gallery and is looking at a series of interviews Billy and I did in 1990–91 for a projected book on art and artists, 1945–1965. [Note: Book never completed; several of the interviews will be published in Burtt’s forthcoming exhibition catalogue, Inventing Downtown: Artist-Run Galleries in New York City, 1952–1965, 2017.] She found an interview Billy and I made with Dore Ashton in 1990–91, where she said that Tinguely asked to meet Bob and that Dore took him to Bob’s studio. Dore was then a curator at MoMA and had arranged for Tinguely to make the self-destructive sculpture in the garden of MoMA. So Tinguely met Bob then, and Bob came to visit them when they were working in the garden and probably met Billy at this time.",510
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20093,"An interview with Julie Martin: It seems it was integrated into the machine as one of the events triggered by the timer circuits that closed. So a circuit closed and I guess there was a resistor that heated up. Maybe Billy told him to put a resistor in there. Because the resistor would overheat and spark. Or it was a spark. I asked Per Biorn about this and he said that a simple overheating resistor, like the ones they used on some of the other elements of Homage, would not have been hot enough to set off the gunpowder. He would have had to have a resistor hooked to some kind of heating coil that would heat up and glow and that would be enough to set off the gunpowder.",146
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20099,"An interview with Julie Martin: Because there’s a plug. Where would it plug into? It had to plug into something. Oh, I never asked him about that, did I? Hmm.",41
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20104,"An interview with Julie Martin: He’s been blind for many years. But, you know, this narrowing of his sight has been going on for a long time. But he stays active on the internet, with voice recognition and the computer reading web pages to him.",55
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20105,"Q: I imagined if it was—just logically, if it’s a mascot, if it’s a pet, then it might be on a leash. [Laughter] It makes perfect sense for it to be connected to Homage.",52
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20110,"An interview with Julie Martin: Absolutely. It would make sense that maybe Bob talked about doing something. Billy said, “Well, if you do it, it needs to plug in. And you’ll be one of the events.”",51
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20111,An interview with Julie Martin: But how? Did they have a strip? Did they have different outlets? How the hell did they do it? How did the timer circuits work? They probably had something with multiple plug-ins because it had to have nine events. How interesting. Nobody’s ever thought about that—wiring the timer.,70
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20109,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, no. Christine Frohnert, who’s the wife of Thomas Buehler, who’s been a curator for Bob since the eighties—a physical curator, installing things [note: at the time of the interview Buehler was Collections Manager]—she and her business partner are conservators of technical works. They’ve just done a study, or are working on a study, of Homage to New York and they’ve followed the photos and the reports. But this is a very interesting thing to ask them. Are the engineers still alive? Harold Hodges is still alive.",134
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20119,"An interview with Julie Martin: Here’s a photo of it in the big retrospective catalogue [Robert Rauschenberg: A Retrospective. Exh. cat. New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1997]. See, there’s a cord. And it’s painted white. There is a cord. Billy says something about, “Bob waited around all day to have his Money Thrower connected.”",93
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20120,"Q: I had thought that it wasn’t connected and he had just arranged the heating element in a way that he knew that after seven minutes, it was going to get to whatever the temperature it would have been that would have set off the gun.",52
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20127,"An interview with Julie Martin: Billy does write that the Money Thrower went off in a big flash. It’s really interesting the questions you don’t ask.

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20124,"An interview with Julie Martin: Actually, you might want to look at an article I wrote for the Foundation for Contemporary Arts’ [note: formerly Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts] fifty-year catalogue—sorry. I’m starting to quote myself.",52
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20134,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, fifty-year. It seems like E.A.T. was founded once the group decided to do the performances in New York. It was for tax-exempt purposes, really, to allow people to contribute money and get a tax deduction. It was founded September 26, 1966, before the 9 Evenings, to function as a tax-exempt organization for donations to the 9 Evenings. But of course, it takes a long time to get a tax-exempt certificate from the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] so the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts continued to be what we now call a fiscal sponsor.",129
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20135,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. The idea was: “This really is a success and artists and engineers can work together. Let’s make it available to other artists.” Initially it had to do a lot with the equipment. If you look at some of the early newsletters, they’re talking about using the equipment that’s available. There was also this overriding idea about artists and engineers working together.",89
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20136,"Q: Even before the event, there was not just [thinking] in terms of funding the event but thinking longer term. A lot of the talking at that point was about the equipment: “We built all this equipment for these artists and it should be shared.” This idea of working with engineers—this was such a great idea, it also should be shared. That we want to create a network because that’s the other purpose that seemed obvious to me. How are engineers going to get in touch with artists? Here’s an organization that’s going to actually get people in contact. Even before 9 Evenings, they were thinking that way.",138
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20137,"An interview with Julie Martin: I went to Canada sometime after 9 Evenings. As I’ve said, I was mostly working with Bob Whitman during the months before the 9 Evenings and wouldn’t have known about the planning, fundraising, et cetera. I remember I worked with Simone on turning her diary and notes kept during the preparations for the 9 Evenings into an article for Artforum, “Theatre and Engineering: An Experiment, [1.] Notes by a Participant.” It accompanied an article by Billy, “[Theater and Engineering: An Experiment, 2.] Notes by an Engineer.” They were both published in the February 1967 issue so we must have worked on the article in November or early December at the latest. It must have been after that that I went to Canada and came back in the spring of ’67. I worked for CBS in the spring and then worked for Christophe de Menil on the second summer of her Midsummer performance series. It was during this summer that Billy and Olga came out to the performances and I remember a meeting on the beach to talk about E.A.T. I don’t know whether Bob R. was there or not.
 Then that fall, I worked for Channel Thirteen on a show about the Russian Revolution. I remember I came in fresh from working on Long Island. Those were the years of short skirts. I think there were remarks at Channel Thirteen, “Who is this woman that’s wearing these short, short skirts?” [Laughter] I didn’t quite fit in but I was helping with research on their program on the fiftieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution. Then the same fall I got involved with E.A.T. That’s a good chronology—a personal chronology. Then in October, I was asked to be one of the hostesses for the E.A.T. press conference at Bob Rauschenberg’s house. That summer Billy and Bob had been introduced to Theodore [W. “Ted”] Kheel by the collector John Powers and Ted began to work with E.A.T. He brought cooperation with organized labor into the mix and suggested a large formal press conference to announce E.A.T.’s collaborations with the technical, industrial, and labor communities. I was around enough to be part of the press conference. Bob silkscreened images of clouds in blue on these paper dresses that the women wore for the festivities. There was an exhibition of works incorporating technology on several floors—Oracle, some neon works, and the press conference in the chapel, with representatives from businesses, Herman [D.] Kenin from the [American Federation of] Musicians union, Senator Jacob [K.] Javits, John Pierce from Bell Labs, et cetera, gave talks.
 I did take part in the press conference and I may have already been working for E.A.T. by that time. And then a few weeks later I was in one of Bob R.’s performances at the School of Visual Arts [New York] called Urban Round [1967]. I think Les Levine did a piece there too and Simone Forti did Slant Board [1961]. For Bob’s piece I remember that there were these wooden boards and you partnered with two other people and sometimes you stood with the board and sometimes you were carried on the board. I think you first stood in the audience area and read something from the paper backwards and when you were finished, you came down to the area with the boards. Maybe when you were not reading you got carried—I can’t remember the instructions. I have seen a photo of the performance with a lot of people and boards in a small space and I recognize myself, with, as I say, longer hair and shorter skirts than today.",805
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20147,"An interview with Julie Martin: No. Just mainly equipment that had been built for 9 Evenings was stored there. Other artists were able to use this equipment. I know Carolee Schneemann used some of the equipment for her performance, Snows [1967]. I remember Max Neuhaus also did something with the equipment.",67
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20144,"An interview with Julie Martin: Huge. It was a 5,000-square-foot loft. In the front they built a little partitioned-off office. It was like the administrative office. Then they built a wall almost all the way across the back. Maybe not a third but a fourth of the way into the space. There was a largish opening in the wall. All the technical stuff was in the back with storage and workbenches and things.",94
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20150,"An interview with Julie Martin: Ralph. Susan Hartnett, who had worked for Bob and who was running the office as general administrative assistant. And me. I think that was it. Oh, no. Maybe a secretary. Maybe Rose Petrock was a secretary. Later she married Ralph. But that was it.",64
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20151,"An interview with Julie Martin: He had been at Bell Labs and then he came to E.A.T. He was a technical assistant at Bell Labs and then he came to E.A.T. as being in charge of the technical equipment. I’m not sure of his title. The titles we gave people, who knows? But he had worked closely with Fred Waldhauer and was familiar with the technical equipment at 9 Evenings and at E.A.T. he would help the artist with technical problems.",108
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20155,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, I don’t think so. There was a conscious decision not to have an E.A.T. laboratory because Billy and Fred thought it could not serve the variety of artists’ needs and it would become outdated very quickly. So the emphasis was on recruiting engineers working in industry and industrial laboratories to work with artists. Thus the artists would be in touch with people working with up-to-date technology in their field. The equipment that was at the E.A.T. loft was the equipment developed for 9 Evenings that was made available to any artist who wanted to use it. Ralph Flynn was soon hired to be in charge of the equipment and to help with artists’ requests. I did an interview with him recently so there might be some information there.",165
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20153,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, ultimately Billy and Fred. I remember meeting Billy and Fred, who asked if I would come work for them to be editor of the E.A.T. News. By that time, they had the loft at 9 East Sixteenth Street and Billy had put out a couple of issues of the newsletter, I’m pretty sure. The first one I worked on—where my name appears as editor—was volume 1, number 3, published on November 1, 1967. But I recently saw that in the previous newsletter that came out June 1, 1967, there is a note that that issue had been put together by Billy, Fred, and Bob R. and with the next issue I would take over as “regular editor.” So I must have been on board or planning to be on board during that summer.
 In the spring of ’67 I was working with Merrill Brockway at CBS and we did one of the segments of his documentary on Bob and on the Revolvers. In those days, you were sort of around. Something happened, you would help or you would maybe volunteer, or you know to go to something.",241
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20163,"An interview with Julie Martin: He went back and then they were moving his laboratory from Murray Hill to Holmdel [New Jersey]. His department moved to Holmdel, about an hour south of Murray Hill, so it would have meant moving his whole family to a new location—further from New York too. A whole commitment to a new situation.",72
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20161,An interview with Julie Martin: No. The idea was both Billy and Bob would go back to what they were doing before. They were both on the board of directors. Billy and Fred came into the office a lot and worked on finding engineers to answer artists’ requests. We began to have an open house on Sundays where the artists and engineers would come and meet each other. Billy was very active but they hired somebody to be the head of E.A.T. But that didn’t last very long.,105
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20268,"Q: The engineer’s never going to become an artist and the artist is never going to become an engineer. You know what you do. I know what I do. You go do your part and I’ll do my part and we’ll put them together. It’s interesting that you never get to the point where this is really an interweaving of the fields. Where suddenly the engineer is a painter, or the engineer is a dancer for a minute.",100
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20274,"Q: I think he said, “Bob felt that I should sign it too.” I think that’s the way he puts it in that essay he wrote. And, “So I put my name as sound engineer.” But it’s interesting that Rauschenberg then did not feel that way about other collaborations.",73
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20275,"An interview with Julie Martin: You’re part of the process in maybe suggesting. Well, let’s say for Solstice [1968]. Bob told [L. J.] Robby Robinson he wanted to do a piece for Documenta [4] and he wanted it to be interactive but obvious to the viewer how it worked. Robby said he thought of doors opening and closing in the Amsterdam airport and suggested sliding doors. Bob came back to him and had the plan for Solstice with five sliding doors the viewers could walk through, opening and closing behind them. Then it was up to Robby to find the sliding doors. He found pneumatic, air- powered doors and I think it was he who decided to use that system. It was a technical decision but I’m sure he ran it by Bob, “We have these air-powered doors.” It’s being involved—you’re contributing your expertise. And both of them are valuable. You’re not saying the artist is more valuable, necessarily. He is in the sense that it’s his artwork and that he signs it. Okay. But it’s the structure, the social structure. In the collaboration, each is necessary. You couldn’t have the artwork without the engineering.",269
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20272,"An interview with Julie Martin: One got used to it, as I said, in the beginning. Then you began to understand. The words I always think of are commitment and responsibility. You worked with somebody. You were committed to working with them. You were doing it because you wanted to work with them. You wanted to work on the project. For them, this idea of taking responsibility for what they’re doing. You had this feeling that you had your own responsibility for whatever it was—whatever role that you were playing or what you were doing. You took it very seriously. You know, personally seriously. I think that’s something that was very—I mean, I don’t know if those words—they’re not words you hear so much now. I think it was very much in the air then and, very much, that’s what, for Bob, collaboration was about: two (or more) people committed to finding a solution and to working on a project. Not dictating exactly what has to be done from start to finish or having the final idea from start to finish.",230
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20273,"An interview with Julie Martin: Not that much, damn it. He talked about the fact that he’d signed it. I don’t think he felt it gave him any particular rights.",41
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20276,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, I have to say that that was something that Billy felt very strongly about. If you’re an engineer, you spent your life learning to be an engineer. You haven’t spent your life learning to be an artist. If you’re an artist, the same thing. Why should an artist have to spend time learning engineering, you know? It was a respect for the professionalism of each of them. It was a real respect for the fact that an artist is an artist. He or she has skills, has abilities, has instincts that are worth preserving. Not preserving—worth regarding. The engineer too comes with his own professionalism. But the collaboration wasn’t just, go off and make it and put them together. There was a conversation there. In Oracle—I mean, certain decisions Bob would make, like choosing small speakers and where he’d put them in each sculpture. He kind of knew. I’m sure that there was talking about it or, “How does this work?” Billy remembers asking Bob, “What do you want the knobs on the top of the staircase to look like?” He could kind of understand certain things. You’re participating if you’re asking. Asking the question means you’ve thought of it and you’re—do you know what I mean? You’re part of the process. So in a way, you become part of the process. You’re just not part of the art-making, the art decision-making process.",331
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20280,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, they worked for several years on Oracle and Billy may have been more hands-on than he was later. Also it was just Billy and his assistant, Harold Hodges, who worked on Oracle. Maybe the later collaborations didn’t go on as long, and more engineers were involved in different aspects of the work.",72
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20281,"Q: What feels counterintuitive to me about it is that if you think about the artists in this generation, they are radically transgressing the boundaries between literature, dance, painting, sculpture—right? There’s never a place where Rauschenberg is saying, “I’m a painter. Yvonne, Trisha, you’re the dancers—” I wouldn’t want to do that. Rauschenberg is out there dancing. But with the engineers, I don’t get the sense that there’s a moment where he says, “Hey, you’re a painter too. You’re a dancer too. Come on in.” Where he said to Billy, “Come on and put on roller skates and get in the show.” That’s what seems—do you see what I mean? That seems counterintuitive. When I think about these artists as artists, part of what’s exciting about this moment is that there’s no division between writing and painting and sculpting and dancing. They’re all doing all of it to some degree. See what I mean?",247
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20286,"Q: I mean, Bob did have some technological knowledge, right? To be able to wire stuff and hook up a clock or hook up an exploding spring. He knew how to do some of that stuff.",42
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20285,"An interview with Julie Martin: He was in Claes’s first piece in the Ray Gun Theater series. You also have to remember that in this period, Billy was a full-time research engineer at Bell Labs. He was incredibly active with the artists in New York, but he did have a full-time job.",66
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20291,"An interview with Julie Martin: Number one, there’s not that big of—well, there was, between, say, dancers and artists. I mean, artists had made sets for dancers. That kind of collaborating on a project—the project of the dance. Bob says he was forced into being a choreographer only because of the mistake on the announcement—he asked first Per Olof Ultvedt, who was a Swedish sculptor visiting New York, and then Alex Hay, who also was not a dancer. He asked Carolyn Brown, who was a superb dancer. He was working within the field of dance. It’s true. Given the fact that they were all friends and they were all in each other’s pieces and in each other’s lives, it doesn’t—I mean, looking out maybe as a theorist, you see it as radical. It was a gradual process from the fifties. You know, Black Mountain [College, North Carolina], they put on theatricals. People performed in other people’s pieces, right?",222
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20293,"Q: Well, it’s interesting. Maybe it is a generational issue because it does feel counterintuitive to me. The other way I’d put it is that I associate this generation of artists with not just destroying the boundaries between art forms but destroying the pretense of expertise. Think of Steve Paxton or Yvonne Rainer and the insistence on the pedestrian. You don’t have to be trained as a dancer. Not to perform in some of Steve’s pieces but to have the idea, to work with ideas of movement in space. To choreograph the pieces, you had to be a choreographer—a professional.",133
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20298,"An interview with Julie Martin: I mean, fine. Fine. You know? Fine.
 Another thing that Billy said that I think is not as popular now. People are talking now so much about art and science—maybe you’ve read—where he felt it was art and engineering. He says that engineers are the people that solve problems. They’re physical. They’re in the world. This is what the artist needs. You were still working with physical things. I always think of the title of Steve Paxton’s piece for 9 Evenings as being emblematic of the work of this period. Physical Things [1966]. The scientist and artist, what are they going to talk about? They’re going to talk about ideas. Fine, but that’s not the collaboration that interested him necessarily. Maybe people now are talking about art and science because things have gotten to the level of trying to—the ideal level. Some of these scientific ideas have been around long enough that they’ve begun to come back into art.
 But at that point, Billy even said toward the end of his life that for him, it was not about art and science. It was about art and engineering and this hands-on relationship to solving problems, finding ways to design or build things.",269
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20299,"An interview with Julie Martin: They weren’t part—there was very little social mingling. Billy was one of the very few people who continued to go to art events. Maybe Fred a little bit. Fred was more into jazz. Jazz was his thing. But for most of the engineers working with artists, art never became part of their world. I think that’s important.",80
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20296,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. How the hell did it work? This is the thing that’s so interesting about oral history, right? You’ve done the same narrative and the same level. But you have to go, “How do you get deeper to facts and to more detail? How do you get more detail?” What ends up getting lost in history? Who knows?
 I think the boundaries were still there. The radical boundaries were the ones within art. I think that’s the thing. But the boundary between art and non-art were still there. It’s blurred now because the guy that writes the program—is he the artist? Or is the artist [the one] that used the program? It’s, unfortunately, blurring. Being an older generation, I’m not so sure it’s a good idea. There is this dancer [Liz Lerman]. This person did something at MSU [Montclair State University, New Jersey]. She had a physics professor be on stage doing something. I didn’t think it was that interesting. But again, for the physicist, on a personal level it may have changed him.",251
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20303,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, but Bob didn’t ask his bookkeeper to be in the pieces. He didn’t necessarily ask Susan Hartnett, who was his secretary. No, I’m not being facetious. I’m trying to work with you on this. I think the people that were in his pieces were friends who also happened to be artists. He asked Carolyn Brown to be in Pelican and then he put her en pointe. He obviously had an image that he wanted to produce. He wanted this counterintuitive ballerina that you put in this very awkward non-ballerina situation. He was working within dance. I also think there was some sense of working with people who were performers and whose work you liked—whose performance style, or lack of style, you liked. There was a shared—I hate to say aesthetic but more a shared approach to what they were doing. They appeared in each other’s works and appreciated each other’s works. Bob R. very much worked with close friends in those years. Steve, Alex, and Deborah were in all of his pieces in 1963, ’64 and ’65. In fact, the four of them formed what they called Bastard Theater and tried to get performance engagements as a group. And the four worked together on performances they gave as side activities during Merce’s world tour in 1964. Both Trisha and Simone were in Linoleum, playing the same part in different productions of the work. Trisha was in Spring Training.
 He didn’t try to do engineering. He didn’t go to the labs and try to tell the engineers what to do— do you know what I mean?",358
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20305,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. He went to things. Bob R. was his friend. Whitman was his friend. Claes and he were friends. Very much so. His life was in the art world and not in the engineering world. Whereas for most of the engineers, their life stayed in the engineering world.",65
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20311,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. The focus for the engineer was on that. The idea was by entering, at least briefly, into this other world, or this other kind of project, this other kind of process. You would take something back to your own engineering work.",56
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20308,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think that may be the clue that you’re looking. Some people like Ralph Flynn left Bell Labs and joined E.A.T. Robby Robinson got involved with Ted Kheel and was doing some projects with Ted Kheel. But for the others, the art wasn’t part of their lives. If you’re an artist and you were looking around for friends to walk across the stage, who did you ask? It’s not that you didn’t ask a scientist. It’s you didn’t know any of them. Billy may not have been available, or Billy may not have been the person that liked to perform. You know? You had to like it or you had to want to do it. I think this is it. I think that the social and the friendship didn’t meld.",183
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20315,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. Utopian. I see now, more and more, E.A.T. as so much a part of this whole utopian fervor of the sixties—of political, social, civil rights, and later women’s rights. It was the manifestation in the art world—or at least in this part of the art world—of those idealistic utopian ideals. I didn’t think about it that way then, although, being part of it, now when I begin to look back and to write about it, I think about it like that—very much so.",128
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20316,"An interview with Julie Martin: No. No. But someone like Per Biorn loved working with artists every chance he got. Later in the eighties and nineties, he was instrumental in renovating Rauschenberg’s pieces that incorporated technology, Dry Cell [1963], Oracle, Soundings. He worked with Bob R. and worked with other artists but his life was in engineering and his engineering job. You really didn’t have to understand the art, either. That was the other thing. The artist’s request was seen as an engineering problem to work on. At E.A.T. there wasn’t any idea of one artist being better than another. There was no aesthetic criteria for “the best artist got the best engineer” or anything like that. Anybody that called up, you tried to match them with somebody whose expertise fitted what they needed.",184
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20317,"Q: Yes. I can now see how it’s different from what was happening in the sixties. I thought of it more as a continuum. I would say it’s valuable, maybe, in a different way.",48
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20320,"An interview with Julie Martin: Too idealistic. Maybe, ultimately, impossible. But also the structures were more rigid in those days—manufacturing structures. One of the things we found when approaching industry to have an artist-in-residence in an industry or carry out a large project, for example, was that the head of the company was very enthusiastic about the idea, but the resistance came from middle management, the people involved in day-to-day operations. The presence of the artist would disrupt the structure he or she had established. Industries were very hierarchical and the idea of collaboration between workers or between departments was not in the air, so to speak. These ideas have only gained traction in recent years. It works individually. It works on individuals. One person at a time.",159
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20327,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. This kind of idealism is probably needed more than ever, in a sense. The problems facing us—the environment, global warming—seem more intractable. There’s less technological optimism. Some of the things that made E.A.T. possible have changed, like a kind of generosity. I think it was easier to live. Living took less money. There was more free time. There was more sense for the engineer that he could come work with an artist and get some sort of satisfaction but not necessarily be paid. Everything didn’t have to be on a paying basis. Now life is really hard, right? It’s very hard. But I do think young artists with their friends volunteer and do the same thing. But I think the time has passed in the sense that that kind of openness and freedom within society for people to volunteer may have passed—a kind of generosity. It may not be possible anymore in that sense but I think the need for this kind of collaboration and the value of it is still valid.
 There’s a young man, Philip Ording. Actually, he’s a mathematician—a topologist—and he’s working with artists now. He worked with Richard Serra on some ideas about what forms will stand up or won’t. He’s worked with Anthony McCall on programming shapes with Anthony’s light pieces and with other artists. He says that it’s made him be able to think more three- dimensionally about the knot problems he works on in his own work. He’s a model of the kind of thing E.A.T. was talking about in the sixties. You work with the artist. You work on problems in your area for the artist who comes back to you in your profession. I think it still is a valuable thing. I just don’t necessarily think putting a physicist on stage directing people is, but, you don’t know. Because who knows? Personally, for him as a person, as a growing experience—I can criticize it from my point of view, but I can also de- criticize it.",454
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20324,Q: There are some of the same arguments of what you were saying about economism. Some of those same arguments. Can you engineer a society? Is it that you institutionalize it and impose the structure top-down? Or do you have to go person-by-person and revolutionize the consciousness?,62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20330,"Q: To some degree, you would say it’s his idealism in that period? Eventually, 9 Evenings is a much bigger thing. The formation of E.A.T. is a much bigger thing. But to some degree, it’s rooted in his idealism, in terms of his profession and his ambitions and these collaborations in the early sixties he’s already involved in.",85
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20331,"An interview with Julie Martin: I guess E.A.T. didn’t want to institutionalize it, but it wanted to broaden the reach of this idea. Maybe the more engineers you reach on an individual level, then the more impact it will have on society. So that is what Billy was feeling in the mid-1960s. If he was the only engineer doing this, it’s not going to go very far. It made some incredible works of art but in terms of social impact, it’s not going to go that far.",115
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20328,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. Definitely. Billy’s and Bob’s. Billy’s encountering Bob, who had his own trajectory towards the same ideas. Maybe not necessarily the same ideas but the trajectory was going in that way. Because if you look on the back there—",61
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20335,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. I think so. Oh, yes. Exactly. I mean, on another level, we were talking about individuals and we were talking about the value for the individual. There’s a man I’ve met, Denis Pelli, who’s working with a dancer, Julia [K.] Gleitch. He is a professor of psychology and neural science at NYU and works in peripheral vision. They collaborated and she made a dance that incorporated some of the findings he has made in his research on peripheral vision. He said that watching her dance has enlarged some ideas for future research. In fact, he’d said he had never thought about perception of moving objects at the periphery of vision until he saw the dance she had created. So this kind of mutual enrichment works and it can work in many different situations. I guess you’re back to the individuals involved. It works on an individual level. E.A.T. tried to institutionalize these kinds of collaborations and bring in industrial support. People going to industries. I think maybe on the institutional level is where it was too soon. It was—",235
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20332,An interview with Julie Martin: These were the three goals that he and Billy—and Billy said that Bob wrote one and three and he wrote number two. Bob’s idea also is quite far-reaching.,43
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20339,"Q: “Eliminate the separation of the individual from technological change and expand and enrich technology to give the individual variety, pleasure and avenues for exploration and involvement in contemporary life.” That’s more what we were talking about before, the individual. The third one would be Bob again?",62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20336,"Q: Bob wrote, “Maintain a constructive climate for the recognition of the new technology and the arts by a civilized collaboration between groups unrealistically developing in isolation.” That’s Bob. This next one is Billy?",48
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20343,"An interview with Julie Martin: It’s important to note that from the very beginning—you see it in the newsletter—all four of the founders saw E.A.T. as a catalyst to bring about change and that, when successful, the role of E.A.T. as a mediator would disappear and many of its functions be taken over by industry, universities, or professional engineering societies. Now, almost fifty years later, you see some of this taking place. Colleges and art schools teach classes in art and technology.
 Collaborations start spontaneously. Industries, especially in the high-tech area, set up or sponsor collaborations between artists and technical people. Although now, very often, it is with the idea that the artist can come up with the next big thing. One recent project was to put artists and technical people—computer programmers as well as engineers—together for twenty-four hours and expect them to come up with a project. It’s a far cry from what we were doing, but certainly the idea of the value of collaboration is well-established in the society.
 Bob moved away from E.A.T. as the sole vehicle for his idealism and social engagement, but never away from his overall commitment to changing the world through his work and his activities. I think so. Not in any kind of intellectual—it wasn’t like, “I don’t think this is going to work,” or, “I don’t believe this anymore.” It was more the way Bob works in series. In a sense, in his work, he did these incredible pieces. The four pieces incorporating technology are among his—I hate to use the word masterpiece, but I find myself using it these days. But Oracle, Solstice, Soundings, and Mud Muse are just incredible pieces. Then he did Revolvers and he did the Carnal Clocks [1969]. Then he moved on in his work. And what did he do? He began to work with the humblest material he could find cardboard. Let’s make pieces with cardboard.
 To me, Bob was always challenging himself. His talent was so great, he could make anything beautiful. He could take anything, put it together and it’s beautiful. It’s an incredible work, right? My feeling is that he constantly challenged himself to broaden himself. To go from this very technical involvement and then all of a sudden to, “Let’s work with cardboard. Let’s make pieces.” He’s not falling back on his preconceived ideas or his talents. He’s trying to work with something that makes him grow. I think throughout his life he did that.",568
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20340,"An interview with Julie Martin: It’s obviously broader. He should have worked on that little bit more. The idea was to get industry more involved. He uses industrialists as part of the support for the technical community to be involved. Bob also had this idea of broader goals for E.A.T. or for the collaboration. Certainly Billy brought his own and then Bob brought his own. They coalesced, or they meshed, at that point.",94
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20345,"Q: It’s an idealism of process. Among the many great Rauschenberg quotes, there’s a great one where the interviewer is asking him, “How do you work?” He says, “I just go into the studio everyday. I just work everyday. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I just keep the place where I don’t know what I’m doing and that’s the place where you find something interesting.”",111
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20350,"An interview with Julie Martin: The change is built in. Well, just by the radios and the five stations. Just from having more than one station and also having the scanning of the stations not stop at one station.",44
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20351,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, that’s what I mean about challenging himself. By choosing new art technologies or bringing new technologies into art, like he did with Don Saff, and printing with hot wax for some of the later ROCI pieces. [Note: Wax Fire Works series, part of ROCI USA, 1990–91] The later pieces that he worked on used unusual substrates—aluminum, copper, then polycarbonates. If you work with something you’ve never worked with before, you can’t predict how it will behave. The process is always new because you don’t know everything about the material. You are, as Bob would say, “collaborating” with it. It can still surprise you. If he had stuck with, say, drawings that were made by transfer rubbing, he would come to know it so well that he would always know how it would react. I didn’t mean he wouldn’t do incredible things. It wouldn’t have been a process into the unknown. The process wouldn’t have led him to unknown outcomes. So he was continually changing his medium and his tools, pushing into his own unknown.",253
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20348,"An interview with Julie Martin: As he said, he had to figure out how to get the first soundtrack for it to bubble to. He hadn’t thought of that, but he enlisted some musicians and they played sounds to it and they recorded that bubbling and that became the activating sound. Even Oracle, now that it is in a museum and the visitor cannot turn the knobs to change the volume or scan rate, it still is changing.",91
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20355,"Q: Rauschenberg has this statement that they have in the archives about his disappointment that people, when presented with the opportunity to steal—but he still has hope, he says that “the piece could be successful in some form.”",51
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20352,"An interview with Julie Martin: Exactly. Then he started working with the clay. When he did the cardboards in clay with [Donald] Don Saff, he was working with the technology within art. [Note: Tampa Clay Pieces, 1972–73] And then ROCI, the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange, which he started in 1984 and pursued for more than six years [1984–91]—the idea of traveling the world, finding materials that mattered to the people in the countries he visited, and then bringing it back to them as art and showing not only art made in and from their culture, but art made from other cultures. His way of spreading knowledge, understanding, friendship, and peace. Many of the countries he chose to go to were not easy and his choices had deep political meaning: Chile, Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, East Berlin, Tibet, Venezuela. He never made “political art” but the act of going to the country, meeting and interacting with artists there, and then making art that expressed or reacted to their culture spread understanding and contact among peoples. He kept his idealism and maybe you could say he found new outlets for it or new forms of it. I don’t think the idealism ever went away. He was always trying to find ways of doing it. I was recently looking at the chronology of his life and work and, year after year, the number of posters or print editions he made for a great variety of causes throughout his life is staggering. Then there was his work with Ted Kheel and the UN [United Nations] international conferences both on the environment and on population growth that he not only made posters for, but also attended.",352
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20353,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. Right. The commitment is to a process of discovery, not a process of perfection. One of the appeals that new technology had for Bob was it offered him the ability to explore an idea he had expressed early on. He had said that if you could remember a painting, it’s dead for you. So for him a challenge was how to keep a painting alive. And in using the new technology offered by Billy and his colleagues he could make works in which there’s no way that you ever see the same image more than once. The image is always changing. In Oracle, the sound is of five radios in which the scanning from station to station never stops, which creates an ever-changing sound space. In Soundings, sounds in the room trigger images of chairs tumbling in space and each sound triggers a different pattern of light. In Solstice, the person walking through it is opening and closing doors in front of and behind himself, creating moving images. And in Mud Muse, the bubbling mud is never still. Although there’s always a mechanism that activates the work, he’s used the mechanism to bring about infinite variety in all those pieces. In the Revolvers, it’s the same. Not only do the round disks move in circles, they move independently of each other and the round disks are never in the same relation to each other. The image the piece presents, even at rest, is never the same.
 That’s what I meant about the artist in this generation having an image or having an idea that he or she wanted to pursue. Then the technology made it possible. The promise of the technology was to fulfill an idea. Not necessarily what it was going to look like because those four pieces couldn’t be more different, right? They have this one thing in common that they’re always changing—either by themselves or by people interacting with them. That was the other thing. He didn’t say, “It has to be interactive.” He had two pieces or three, including the Revolvers, that were interactive. The viewer participates in creating the image they experience. But they didn’t have to be. In fact when Bob started to work on what became Mud Muse, he expressly decided not to make it interactive or responsive to the environment. It bubbles to its own sounds.",494
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20356,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. But Bob’s original idea was that the individual—the viewer—could change the volume and the rate of speed of the change from station to station. Now it’s in a museum, the Musée National d’Art Moderne at Centre Pompidou in Paris. It’s too valuable. God forbid people should touch it.",82
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20357,"Q: No, I was reading about another—it wasn’t a collaboration with Billy—but they were both there. Bob did this piece called Black Market [1961] that he took from Amsterdam to Sweden, where people were supposed to take something from the box and leave something of your own and replace it and people just stole stuff.",70
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20360,"An interview with Julie Martin: Of course, that was very early for the idea of interactive works of art, or for the viewer to participate in the work. Now you’d probably have people dying to put something in. But again, Bob was ahead of his time, totally ahead of his time.",62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20366,An interview with Julie Martin: I guess I did. The point is I have ideas about him. I don’t remember as much really specifically—we were sitting around and Bob said X—whereas there would be other people who do. I remember reactions to things and thinking about him.,60

A219 9 Evenings statement,Q23742,"For the artist the access to professional technology promises the development of a new esthetics which has a greater relevance to present day society.

A219 9 Evenings statement,Q23743,"For the engineer the contact with the artist could mean a dislocation or shift in the traditional way of working and thinking. The suggestions of the artists are derived from a different psychological background than those of the engineers. The stimulating influence that the contact with the artist has on the engineer benefits of course ultimately the industrial laboratory where the engineer works. Although the artist himself is not realizing or interested in practical applications of his ideas, the engineer is free to do so. As long as the artist may work freely within his own vision and can deal with the engineer in a realistic situation as required by the industry the cooperation has the possibility to be fruitful.

The industry must be able to count on the possibility of profit and the artist must be able to realize his work.

The industrial laboratory could give the artist a contract which would allow the artist the possibility to realize his ideas in co- operation with the engineer. The equipment built would belong to the artist or an appropriate Foundation, the practical ideas and patenets that result would belong to the industry.

A214 9 Evenings remarks by John Cage,Q23783,"Now we have another way of making art that is less individual and more social. It is an activity that is possible only because a number of people come together and join, so to speak, forces. This festival of theater and engineering is an example. Buckminster Fuller speaks of synergy, an energy that results from several energies being combined and which is greater than their sum. Art instead of being an object made by one person becomes a process set in motion by a group of people, in this case artists and engineers. It is not someone saying something, but people doing things that give everyone (including those involved) the opportunity to have experiences they would not otherwise have had.

A214 9 Evenings remarks by John Cage,Q23781,"People often ask me whether new developments in art take the place of art as it used to be. My view is that far more directions for art are now available than were formerly and that no direction takes the place of another. We are, so to speak, these days richer. We have everything we used to have. The Mona Lisa, for instance, is still with us. On top of which we have the Mona Lisa with a moustache.",93
A214 9 Evenings remarks by John Cage,Q23787,"My own project is simple to describe. It is a piece of music, Variation VII, indeterminate in form and detail, making use of the sound system which has been devised collectively for this festival, further making use of modulation means organized by David Tudor, using as sound sources only those sounds which are in the air at the moment of performance, picked up via the communication bands, telephone lines, microphones, together with, instead of musical instruments, a variety of household appliances and frequency generators.

 When you're workingwith something that's as physical as radio equipment, what's absurdto dois very quickly determined. The machine[?] has no tolerance for getting outside a particular radio wave or whatever it is you're working with.

But it's much more complicated for an artist to deal with qualities like honesty [???] integrity and fact. 
 
 Isn't there a kind of intimidation going on; 1ike: technology, even if it isn't functioning, is perfect?

A118 Brochure for Giant Model Airplanes: A Benefit Exhibition,Q23896,"GIANT MODEL AIRPLANES a benefit exhibition for EAT You are cordially invited to a non-profit exhibition and auction of GIANT MODEL AIRPLANES for the benefit of EXPERIMENTS IN ART AND TECHNOLOGY, INC., at the studio of ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG, 381 Lafayette Street, New York, New York, June 6-8, 1967. The exhibition consists of precisely scaled and detailed enlargements of stick-and-tissue-type models of vintage aircraft including two S.E. 5A SCOUT BIPLANES and a FOKKER DR-1 TRIPLANE--the type made famous by Baron Manfred Von Richthofen during World War I. MR. CHARLES ALLSOPP, the famous fine art auctioneer of CHRISTIE'S OF LONDON will conduct the auction beginning at 10:00 P.M. sharp on Thursday, June 8. The giant models were conceived and built by GEORGE MANUPELLI and JOSEPH WEHRER. Both are professors at The University of Michigan and active in the experimental music-theatre activities of the ONCE Group. Dr. Manupelli is also Director of the ANN ARBOR FILM FESTIVAL. The models are two-thirds actual size with wing spans of nearly 18 feet. They are made of pine, uncovered, and designed as outdoor sculpture that weather gradually and gracefully with time. Each is manned by a plastic pilot and has a movable propeller powered by a giant rubber band. Individual parts are numbered, while major sections easily disassemble for shipping or storage. Other artists who worked on the project are WILLIAM FINNERAN, who produced the cowl and propeller assemblies; DAVID HAXTON, who painted the huge facsimile of the box in which the original model kits are sold; MARY ASHLEY, who produced the giant simulated model plans; NICHOLAS BERTONI, who was the project engineer; and CHRISTOPHER FRAYNE, KATHLEEN YOUNG, CYNTHIA LIDDELL, and ANNE WEHRER. The group is known as the PLASTER OF PARIS AIRCRAFT CORP., D. DeVarti, Prop. EAT, Inc. is a non-profit tax-exempt foundation to promote direct collaboration between artists and technologists with the cooperation of industry. Hours for the exhibition are 2:00-8:00 P.M. on Tuesday and Wednesday, June 6 and 7, and 2:00-10:00 P.M. on Thursday, June 8. Bids may be submitted in advance through CHRISTIE'S OF LONDON, 867 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10021. Telephone (212) 774-4017. All bids should be made or confirmed in writing or by telegram.

NINE EVENINGS: THEATER AND ENGINEERING Remarks by Oyvind Fahlstrom September 29, 1966 In my piece, ""Kisses Sweeter Than Wine,"" I approach the new technology on several levels. Chemicals developed by the new technology permit me to use elements formerly not possible--an object gradually changing color, ""snow bubbles"" rising from the ground, people enveloped by ""clouds."" By utilizing our internal broadcasting system, I can have pillows sing out while they are bounced on the floor or thrown in the air. By utilizing our remote control system,I can have an actor pursued by an air- borne object or direct the same object to approach floating targets. On another level, my piece deals with machine-1ike qualities in people: robot-like people capable of memorizing enormous amounts of data or of making multi- digit calculations in their heads (as found in psychiatric literature); the risk of putting ""robots"" (narrow minds) in situations for which they are not ""programmed""-- i.e., crisis situations--and machines getting out of control. Juxtaposed with this are glimpses of everyday events and characters of the world of today. Bob Hope and Mao Tse Tung appear in New York City street demonstrations, for example. For this we will use films of an actual demonstration along with tapes of the reactions of the people who see it. Tape and film become a part of the piece. New York, China, Indonesia, the bottom of the sea, space, the world of the future (as seen in a science fiction movie)--all are interwoven into a triptych of slide, movie, and television screens. There is no explanation. The spectator draws conclusions or not, as he chooses. I think of it as initiation rites for a new medium, Total Theater. ",419

NINE EVENINGS: THEATER AND ENGINEERING 
Remarks by Deborah Hay 
September 29, 1966
September 29, 1966 ""Solo"" is a white, even, clear event in space. The performers are part of the space and 1ight. They continue the quality of the area--a white environment. All movement is with the intention of maintaining a balance of order and evenness.
""Solo"" is cumulative, gradually accumulating more light, more platforms, more performers, more activity--yet remaining as still and composed as in the beginning.
There are 24 performers. Eight of the performers remain stationery. Formally dressed, they are seated as a musical1 ensemble. From this position they operate eight remote control platforms, which move in and around the space. Sixteen of the performers also move in and around the space, sometimes on the platforms.
Bright lights around the stage area are strongly reflected by the white costumes of the 16 moving performers. The extreme intensity of light bouncing off the costumes modifies the lines of the human body. At times there are no lights. I am interested in creating a middle ground between seeing and not seeing.
The principal visual elements of the piece are moving performers, lights, darkness, remote control platforms, and movement. It is my main intention to make all these elements equal in energy and visibility. I will also use a tape of electronic music by Toshi Ichiyanagi.

On behalf of the Tekniska Museet and Dagens Nyheter we wish to express our appreciation and sincere gratitude for all your interested efforts and hard work, you have devoted to engineer all kinds of new and brilliant projects for the Festival of Art and Technology. Though the Festival will not take place in Stockholm - which we regret very deeply - we are convinced that your work will prove to be a fruitful contribution to the advancement of both Art and Technology.

With the Festival now being launched in the New York Armory - rich in traditions - we hope that the event will be a great succes, and that this will give you full compensation for the frustrating difficulties entangled in the Stockholm project. We wish you good luck. Should you happen to pass through Stockholm in the future, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

 NINE EVENINGS: THEATER AND ENGINEERING
 September 29, 1966 
 Rauschenberg Note
 My theater piece (to date unnamed) begins with an authentic tennis game with rackets wired for transmission of sound. The sound of the game will control the lights. The game's end is the moment the hall is totally dark. The darkness is illusionary. The hall is flooded with infra-red (so far invisible to the human eye). A modestly choreographed cast of from 300 to 500 people will enter and be observed and projected by infra-red television on large screens for the audience. This is the limit of the realization of the piece to date.
 Tennis is movement. Put in the context of theater it is a formal dance improvisation. The unlikely use of the game to control the lights and to perform as an orchestra interests me. The conflict of not be ing able to see an event that is taking place right in front of one except through a reproduction is the sort of double exposure of action. A screen of light and a screen of darkness.

For two long days last weekend artists and engineers alternately conferred and tested the first electronic environmental system ever developed for theater use. Called THEME (Theater Environmental Modular Electronic), the system is the most ambitious of the technical1 projects undertaken in connection with the ""Nine Evenings."" ",383
A210 9 Evenings press release,Q24013,"-2- THEME was designed to fill the requirements of ten artists' specific theatrical situations. It consists of 289 components portable electronic - amplifiers, equalizers, transmitters, receivers, distant control equipment, and proportional control equipment. It permits simultaneous remote control of multiple sounds, lights, and movements of objects. Various aspects of THEME will be utilized by all of the participating artists, either alone or in conjunction with special technical units required by individual artists. The reason for the impromptu tennis game, for example, was to test the frequency of the sound of a tennis ball hitting the racquet, which Robert Rauschenberg will use to stimulate a visual reaction through the system. Later in the same piece, however, independently operated television equipment will also play a key role. One of the most significant aspects of the system is its versatile proportional control system, which can be used as a portable electronic dimmer board, in itself an engineering first. It was developed especially for the pieces by David Tudor and Deborah Hay. Tickets for the nine performances will be priced at $3 each. Ticket information will be available after September 20 by calling 689-3315 (area code 212).

 MAX-FEED [Max Fee] THE PIECE COULD ACTUALLY BE DESIGNED IN MANY WAYS. THE REQUIREMENTS I SET FOR MYSELF WERE TO MAKE SOME- THING THAT WOULD CREATE THE TYPE OF FEEDBACK SOUNDS WHICH I HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN AND PERFORMING WITH. SOMETHING THAT WOULD CREATE THESE SOUNDS IN A LIVE, UN- STABLE, MALLEABLE, BUT NOT CONTROLLABLE FORM. AND THAT WOULD BE CHEAP ENOUGH FOR PRACTICALLY ANYONE TO AFFORD, BUT STILL NOT SACRIFICE FREQUENCY RESPONSE. TO GIVE THESE SOUNDS TO PEOPLE IN A FORM THAT HAS THE CON- STANT AVAILABILITY AND LISTENING PRIVACY OF A RECORDING, AND YET IS NOT A PAST EVENT PRESERVED BUT SOMETHING WHICH IS CONTINUING AND IN THE PRESENT. THE CIRCUIT UTILIZES THE INHERENT IDIOSYNCRACIES AND INSTABILITY OF THE PARTS AND CIRCUITRY OF A TWO TRANSISTOR RADIO FROM JAPAN. BY ADDING A MICROPHONE AND A STAGE OF AMPLIFICATION COUPLED TO A CIRCUIT OSCILLA TING AT RADIO FREQUENCIES, AN EXTREMELY CONTAGIOUS FEEDBACK LOOP IS SET UP WHICH WILL ENCOMPASS ANY NEARBY RADIO RECEIVER. THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT ADVANTAGES TO MAKING THE CLOSING LINK OF THE FEEDBACK LOOP RADIO TRANSMISSION. ONE, THAT THE PROCESS AND INTERFERENCE INVOLVED IN TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING FURTHER MOLDS AND SHAPES THE SOUNDS. AND TWO, THAT IT PROVIDES A UNIVERSAL AND ALMOST FOOLPROOF ACCESS TO ITS OWNER'S HI FI SYSTEM, MAKING THE HI FI SYSTEM PART OF THE FEEDBACK LOOP AND EXPANDING THE FREQUENCY POSSIBILITIES OF THE PIECE TO THOSE OF THE HI FI SYSTEM WITH WHICH IT IS BEING USED.

 Over 30 engineers from Bel1 Telephone Laboratories, Inc. have devoted their spare time for nearly nine months to finding solutions to performance problems posed by new concepts of the artists. They have created mechanical and electronic equipment and developed chemical materials which permit totally new means of expression.
 
 Billy Kluver of the Physical Optics and Electronics Research Department at Bell Laboratories supervised and coordinated the work of the engineers. For six years he has put technology to work for such artists as Jean Tingueley, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, John Cage, and Andy Warhol. ""These artists could not complete their intentions without the engineer because they incorporate his work in the painting, sculpture, or performance."" explains Kluver. ""Nine Evenings"" marks the first such effort on a major scale.
 
 Audiences during the ""Nine Evenings"" will experience new forms of artistic expression. They will seldom be aware of the technical means which make them possible. One of the most ambitious projects undertaken in connection with ""Nine Evenings,"" for example, is a new electronic environmental theater system. Called THEME (Theater Environmental Modular Electronic), the system was designed to fill the requirements of specific theatrical situations for all ten artists. It permits simultaneous remote control of multiple sounds, lights, and movements of objects and will be used extensively but wi11 never be visible to the audience.
 
 Those technical units which can be seen are integral parts of individual works. Oyvind Fahlstrom will use motion picture, television, and slide projection screens to present several aspects of a subject simultaneously--as for example, when details of onstage or offstage action

 are picked up by television cameras and shown while the action is in progress. Lucinda Childs has had a special unit built to permit the performer of her piece to float without physical exertion.
 
 For artists this first serious encounter between art and technology has opened the door to a new freedom of expression--and the possibility of virtually limitless new media in store for the future. For engineers it has provided a series of stimulating and improbable challenges, rewarding both in themselves and in the fresh approaches they suggest. For industry a lasting alliance between art and technology holds special implications as demonstrated by the commercial potential of scientific discoveries made in connection with ""Nine Evenings.""
 
 ""The artist's work, like that of the scientist, is an investigation which may or may not yield meaningful results."" says Billy Kluver. ""Often we do not know the results of this investigation for many years. A1l of the art projects that I have worked on have at least one thing in common: from an engineer's point of view they are ridiculous. That is their value. Perhaps the greatest gift art can make to research is the unique intuition and insight of the artist. The use of the engineer by the artist will stimulate new ways of looking at technology and of dealing with life.""

 Xerox Corporation Midtown Plaza 
 Rochester, New York
 Dear Mr. Wilson:
 As discussed with John Powers, I am writing to solicit financial support for the 1955 Festival of Theater and Engineering.
 The Festival was conceived as an exposition of the creative possibilities inherent in the interaction of art and science. Ten artists concerned with using technology as material for art have been working closely with about 30 scientists and engineers, under the leadership of Billy Kluver, since last January. The artists suggested problems and ideas for performance situations; the engineers designed and built very advanced technical equipment which in turn stimulated new ideas for the artists. The ten artists working on the project are:
 Lucinda Childs choreographer, dancer
 John Cage Composer, writer
 Oyvind Fahlstrom  painter, poet
 Alex Hay  painter, choreographer
 Deborah Hay choreographer, dancer 
 Claes Oldenburg painter, happening-author
 Steve Paxton  choreographer, dancer
 Robert Whitman sculptor, happening-author
 David Tudor  musician
 Robert Rauschenberg painter, choreographer
 All the artists have exhibited or performed their works in the past and all are artists of great reputation and daring.
 The Festival vill take place at the Armory at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street, from October 12 - 23, 1966. The budget is $50,000, covering the cost of designing and building the equipment, production costs, rental of the Armory, lighting and staging expenses, insurance, fees and the like.
 We have raised approximately $12,000 from individual contributions. Supporting us are Robert Scull, Virginia Kondratief, Seymour Schweber, Leo Castelli, Walter Gutman and others. In view of their conservative stockholder and current government problems, Bell Laboratories is supporting the project by contributing laboratory facilities as well as its top engineers and scientists.

 Mr. B. F. Waple - 2
 We have carefully examined the probability of interference to FM broadcasters from this operation and conclude that the probability of such interference is extremely unlikely. We cite as evidence of this conclusion, measurements made external to the armory where the experiment is to be conducted, on the field strength of FM broadcast stations, of which WVNJ is typical, which produce field intensities as shown in the attached Exhibit 6. Since the frequencies we seek do not immediately overlie or interfere with the assigned frequencies of the local FM outlets, additional protection to their operations is provided. In laboratory measurements in shielded locations, we have found that the six db per octave attenuation of the primary transmitter emission, from the foreshortened whip antenna-equipped 10 mW sources, produce fields not in excess of 250V per meter at a distance of 200 feet. At the same distance, the licensed broadcast emissions produce 50,000 V/m. Since 200 feet is just outside the perimeter of the building structure, where experimental authority is sought, corresponding attenuation with distance should make the contribution of the portable units to the ambient provided by the broadcast outlets, undiscernible at any location where the use of an FM receiver for broadcast listening is geographically feasible. 
 We appreciate that the Commision may find difficulty in reconciling its obligation to protect the broadcaster from interference by other nonbroadcast users. Nonetheless, we urge that the Commission accept our assurances that interference in this case is unlikely, that no regular operation is con- templated, that no objective is sought but that which may devolve to the general benefit of the public. 
 We have shown in the attached Exhibits how the proposed experiment will be conducted, but no amount of technical description can properly deal with the expressive arts. In this regard, we crave the Commission's indulgence to appreciate what we propose to accomplish, by offering to demonstrate to the Commission how this experiment will assist in the development of a new aesthesis. We would be happy to make this demonstration at the convenience of the Commission, either prior to or during the public demonstration.

 We would, of course, file on conclusion of this experiment, a full report on how the use of the communication authority we seek has made contributions to the overall experiment.
 We believe that the Commission will, in considering favorably this application, have provided an important public service in assisting in the demonstration of what we believe to be a significant bridge between Art and Technology. If there are any further questions which the Commission may have in regard to any aspect of the proposed experiment, please advise us. 
 Very truly yours,
 JILL JAKES (Director of the Foundation)

 The Festival will be covered thoroughly by the press. LIFE, ESQUIRE, and other national magazines have planned feature stories. Naturally the specialized magazines in the fields of art, dance, music, science and engineering will give very heavy before and after coverage. In addition, a new environmental publication called BROADSIDE, published by Marion Javits and Clay Felker, will devote its entire first issue to the Festival.
 While there has been a great deal of interest expressed by the networks and local stations in doing television programs on the Festival, we have kept the television rights free. We would be happy to make whatever arrangements you would find most suitable for television coverage of the Festival.
 We anticipate a paid audience of 15,000 at a minimum. However, even with capacity business, the Festival would not be a ""commercial"" venture. Any profits would go towards a new foundation to further the creative collaboration of artists and scientists.  
 I will be doing a poster for the Festival which would of course be available to Xerox for its advertising and promotion purposes. In addition, we would be delighted to have Xerox machines print the programs for the audience as they enter the Armory. The artists and scientists are all open to any other ideas and suggestions for the participation of Xerox in this project. 
 As LIFE magazine says in its current issue, ""the Festival, which Will take place in the same Armory as the 1913 Armory Show, may go down in art history as another landmark"". In our opinion, LIFE is too cautious. The Festival will be a unique avant-garde event. As a pioneering effort, it should create great excitement and reward its sponsor with important publicity and prestige.
 I hope that you will share our enthusiasm and give us your financial support.  Since we are pressed by time, I would appreciate your reactions as soon as possible. 
 With thanks in advance.
 Sincerely, Robert Rauschenberg

 August 29, 1966
 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20554
 Gentlemen: Attention: Mr. Ben F. Waple, Secretary
 Attached hereto are duplicate preparations of Forms 403 and 440, with which we seek authority for a short-term, experimental transmission program, in the Experimental Radio Service, pursuant to Rule Part 5.202d, where the proposed experiment would require a research communications capability as an adjunct to a non-radio research study involving technological expressions of art forms. In the proposed experiment, the communications capability would provide means for the control of 1ighting, sound, motors and music, to develop aesthetic environments and would demonstrate the capability of technology to provide a new dimension in the expressive arts. The communications function we seek could, we feel, best be accomplished by providing transmission to a multiplicity of portable FM broadcast band receivers, from 15 similar crystal-controlled portable transmitters, of 10 mW input power rating, operating into foreshortened whips. These transmitters would be carried on the persons of performers whose movements would be confined to a space' some 100 by 100 feet in the center of the 69th Infantry Regiment Armory building, located at 68 Lexington Avenue in New York City, or the transmitters may be used in connection with the communication system described in the attached Exhibit 4 and used within the same area.
 The duration of the proposed experimental study would not exceed 16 days commencing on October 8th and terminating on October 23, 1966. During the study, the public will be invited to observe the performances from October 13 to October 23.
 The times of day in which the proposed experiment would be repeated are 8:30-12:00 p.m.  However, intermittent testing to verify that all units are functional may require as much as three hours additional per day, during the period October 8 to October 23.

 Mrs. Albert A. List 
 927 Fifth Avenue 
 New York, New York
 Dear Vera: 
 In our telephone conversation the other day you asked for more information on the 1966 Festival of Theater and Engineering. I hope this will give you a clear idea of what we are doing. 
 ""We"" are 10 New York artists:
 Lucinda Chi1ds- choreographer, dancer 
 John Cage- composer, writer, 
 Oyvind Fahlstrom- painter, poet 
 Alex Hay painter, choreographer 
 Deborah Hay- choreographer, dancer 
 Claes Oldenburg - painter, happening-author 
 Steve Paxton choreographer, dancer 
 Robert Whitman - sculptor, happening-author 
 David Tudor musician
 and myself. All the artists have exhibited/performed their works here in the past and all are artists of great reputation and daring. We are all involved in our own individual ways of experimenting with modern technology and exploring the possibilities of the interaction between art and professional technology.
 Since last January we have been working steadily with about 30 engineers from Bell Laboratories, led by Billy Kluver, the technical engineer for Tinguely, Johns and others. The artists suggested ideas and problems for performance situations and the engineers came up with ingenious technical solutions. In the spring we began building equipment and now we have almost all the devices completed. The cooperation of the artists and scientists has produced very exciting and [fruitful] POSITIVE achievements.
 Originally we were to perform in a Festival of Art and Technology in Stockholm this September. However, serious differences arose between our Swedish sponsor and ourselves in attitude and approach toward the Festival. These conflicts prevented the rapport necessary for this large scale international project. Although the cancellation of the Stockholm arrangements was a rough setback, the American artists and scientists refused to lose the courage of their commitment. Together we have resolved to make a success of the Festival here in New York.

 Our plans are as follows:
 11 performances, from October 13-23, 1966. The Festival will be held at the Armory at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street, a marvelous space for our performances. The budget is $50,000, covering the cost of designing and building the technical equipment, production costs, rental of the Armory, lighting and stage expenses, insurance fees and the like.
 We anticipate a minimum audience of 10,000 people. This is a conservative estimate, since there will be thorough press coverage. LIFE, ESQUIRE, and other national magazines plan feature stories. of course, the art, dance/music and science/engineering publications will give us very heavy before and after coverage. Some interest has been expressed by a television network for a special on the Festival, and several local TV stations plan some coverage. In addition, a new environmental publication called BROADSIDE, published by Marion Javits and Clay Felker, will devote its entire first issue (guest edited by me) to the Festival.
 Even with capacity crowds, however, the Festival is not a ""commercial"" venture. Any profits will go towards a new foundation for the development of our ideas. Art critics and philosophers have recently become excited by the interaction of the two formerly opposite poles of art and technology. Scientists and artists have much to learn from each other and their exchange has unknown possibilities. This inter-discipline activity is inevitable, but we feel we can give it an immediate push-in the right direction. X
 As LIFE magazine says in its current issue, the Festival ""which will take place in the same Armory as the 1913 Armory Show, may go down in art history as another landmark"". In my opinion, LIFE was being too cautious. The Festival will be a unique [as a totally vanguard] AVANT GARDE occurrence. New ground needs to be broken and it should be here in New York, the vital center of art and technology. 
 Vera, I hope that you will share our enthusiasm and give us your financial support. Since we are pressed by time, I would appreciate your reactions as soon as possible. With thanks in advance.
 Sincerely, Robert Rauschenberg
 Note: Add for industry people at X on second page: Industry is one of the greater influences on our lives and should take a significantly larger role in our cultural activities. It is our hope that industry will understand and aid the artist to use new technology in a professional way as a material for art.  Also make appropriate changes in the opening and closing paragraphs.

 Twenty and 30 years ago , modern dance riveted critics and angered audiences . Avant - garde composers like John Cage were making disjointed and dissonant music , and dancers and choreographers like Merce Cunningham were breaking the rules of classical dance . Pop artists glorified the most commonplace objects, epitomized by Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup Can , and the young generation reveled in the newness of it all.
 Rauschenberg assimilated all the arts . In 1954 he began his life - time involve ment with performance . He designed sets , costumes and props for dance companies like Cunningham's and on occasion also choreographed and danced for them to music by Cage . Like his combines of the same period which stunried the art world , the performance material was perceived as audacious , even shocking .
 But as these costumes and props hang on walls and sit on the floor today , they are neither interesting nor do they possess sensual or thoughtful appeal. One can only remember that these things on display in the museum's lower gallery are out of place and context , for their life depends on the life given them by movement and sound.

 INTRODUCTION 
 I was born in Monaco and grew up in Sweden. After graduating from the Royal  Technical University in Stockholm, I came to the US, received a PhD in Electrical  Engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, and joined the Communications  Research Department at Bell Laboratories in 1958 doing theoretical and experimental  work on free electron beams and lasers. As a student in Sweden, I had been interested in  film, and I soon began to meet artists and filmmakers in New York.  I was concerned about the social implications of science and technology, and I came to  believe that a meeting of art and science could only take place on a practical, physical  level.  
 I began to work with artists in New York in the early 1960s on works that used sound,  light, movement and new technical materials. I developed the idea that one-to-one  collaborations between an artist and an engineer or scientist could satisfy the artists’  desire to work with the new technology and produce works of art that could not be  realized any other way. And the collaboration could also work both ways. Artists'  projects could stimulate the engineer in new ways of looking at technology and influence  technical development in the future.  
 These social concerns and the importance of providing the artist with access to new  technology led artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman, and engineer Fred  Waldhauer and myself to found Experiments in Art and Technology, a not-for-profit  
 service organization whose goal was to promote collaborations between artists, engineers  and scientists.  
   The Story of E.A.T.,  covers this history from my first collaboration with Jean  Tinguely on Homage to New York in 1960, through 9 Evenings: Theatre & Engineering  in 1966 and the founding of Experiments in Art and Technology the same year, and then  presents E.A.T.’s activities and projects from 1966 to the present. It chronicles the birth  and early years of what has come to be called the art and technology movement, which  has grown and developed in many directions, involving thousands of artists, engineers  and scientists in all fields, producing works that reach and inspire an ever-growing  audience.

Story of E.A.T. Part I,Q24638,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: To find works by American artists for the Art in Motion show, I began to visit artists’  studios, climbing staircases to the artists’ lofts, where many lived illegally, so you first  had to shout for them to drop down keys to the door.  
 To the left is Richard Stankeiwicz’s sculpture Apple. I had asked him if he needed any  technical help with the timing and relay switches, and he sent back a meticulously drawn  diagram of them. He knew exactly what he was doing.  
 The middle painting is Robert Rauschenberg’s Black Market. You were invited to move  the art yourself by writing your name on one of the four pads hanging on the painting,  taking one of the four objects from the suitcase attached to the painting and putting  another object in its place. Rauschenberg made the painting to the right in Stockholm. At  the gala opening, a lady pointed to the painting and shouted, “Ingemar Johansson [the  boxer] could have done that painting!” To her horror, Bob ran over to the painting and  wrote, “This is Johansson’s painting...” before she knocked his arm away. The writing is  still there.",281
Story of E.A.T. Part I,Q24639,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: When Pontus first came to New York in 1959, I had a car and took him around to visit  artists. Pontus knew Sam Francis from Paris and we soon met his neighbor on 23rd  Street, the painter Alfred Leslie, who had just made the film Pull My Daisy with Robert  Frank. Leslie’s enthusiasm helped spark Pontus’ interest in contemporary American art as  did Dorothy Miller’s exhibition Sixteen Americans at the Museum of Modern Art.  Moderna Museet’s first exhibition devoted to contemporary American art opened on  March 17, 1962. Pontus chose Alfred Leslie and three artists who had been in the Art in  Motion show: Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Richard Stankeiwicz. The show  was accompanied by programs of independent films from the New American Cinema.  Pontus again put me to work as Moderna Museet’s New York agent; and I collected and  shipped films and works for the exhibition, becoming friendly with the shippers W.R.  Keating and Budworth. I encouraged Pontus to buy works by the young New York  artists. Shown here to the left on the floor is Rauschenberg’s Monogram, which Pontus  did buy for the museum.",280

Pontus Hulten told me that I should ask him if he needed any help. He had received an  offer to build a sculpture in the garden of the Museum of Modern Art. I asked Tinguely,  ”What do you need?” His answer was, “bicycle wheels.” We gathered the material from  bicycle shops in New Jersey and the garbage dumps on the New Jersey flats. It took us  three weeks to build what he wanted, a self-destructing machine. With the help of my  
 friends at Bell Telephone Laboratories, we constructed timing and triggering devices to  release smoke, start a fire in a piano, break support members, and make noises. On the  evening of March 17, 1960, the machine, which Jean called Hommage to New York,  performed to a museum society audience with smoke billowing out from the structure  and the piano playing. It destroyed itself in 27 minutes. What remained of the machine  was carted back to the dumps in New Jersey.",252

Part I,Q24637,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: Pontus Hulten, director of Moderna Museet in Stockholm, asked me to be the American  Representative for the Art in Motion exhibition at the museum, an expanded version of  an exhibition he had made at the Denise Rene gallery in Paris in 1955. In the early 60s  Pontus worked closely with Willem Sandberg at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam,  and Art in Motion opened first at the Stedelijk. An expanded version with more than 200  works by 80 artists opened in Stockholm on May 17, 1961. Outside the museum was  Alexander Calder’s sculpture Four Seasons, which Pontus had built from the 1939 model  that Calder gave him during our visit to Roxbury in the fall of 1959. For the the American  contribution to the exhibition I asked a number of artists to make works for the  exhibition. We also included designs by Charles Eames and the drawings of Rube  Goldberg, and I arranged shipment of classic works of Marcel Duchamp, Naum Gabo  and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, whose sculpture, Lichtrequisite, Pontus and I found in a  packing case at the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard.

I had  met Öyvind in the Student Film Society at University in Stockholm, which was the only  intellectual extracurricular group except for the Communist-led Clarte. Originally a  writer and poet, he was a self-taught painter, unlike his wife Barbro Ostlihn, who had  graduated from the Royal Academy in Stockholm. When he told me during one of my  
 visits to Stockholm in the early 1960s that he and Barbro planned to move to the United  States, I offered my help to find a place for them to stay. They arrived on a cargo ship in  Baltimore and stayed for a while at 600 Park Avenue with the Swedish Consul General,  who happened to be Barbro’s uncle. Bob Rauschenberg was leaving his loft on Front  Street, and I asked him if Öyvind and Barbro could take over the lease, which they did.  For years I used to go by their place by around 2 o’clock in the morning on my way home  from an opening or a party and talk to Öyvind while he was working, often assisted by  Barbro who left her paintings, highly geometric renderings of architectural details of New  York buildings, to help him when one of his shows at the Sidney Janis Gallery was near.",313

I worked with him to  assemble the show, and Ileana Sonnabend in Paris was particularly helpful in getting  works that were already in Europe. We also showed programs of American independent  films. Roy Lichtenstein made the poster for the show, and the exceptional catalogue was  printed on colored paper with a different color for each artist: Dine, Wesselman,  Lichtenstein, Oldenburg, Segal, Rosenquist, Warhol and Wesselman. The exhibition,  which opened on February 29, 1964, raised a lot of consternation in Swedish academic  art circles. I remember vigorously arguing in front of the television camera in favor of  Oldenburg pies. The only paper that touched the subject was VI, the mouthpiece for  Swedish cooperative movement, which printed my article, Pastry as Art.

Story of E.A.T. Part I,Q24640,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: In 1961, I arranged to have Hans Nordenström’s short to-the-point comic strips published  in The Village Voice. When this one appeared, I got a call from Audrey Sabol from  Philadelphia, who wanted to buy the original for her son who was weight lifter. We met  at the bar at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. I found out that Audrey, Joan Kron, and  Acey Wolgin were planning to mount an exhibition of American painting at the  YM/YWHA in Philadelphia. I convinced them to make an exhibition of the new  generation of artists and I helped them select the show from my artist friends in New  York. They called the exhibition Art 1963: A New Vocabulary, which has since led to  some confusion, since it opened October 25, 1962. It was beaten by a month from being  the first pop art exhibition in America, although it was the first on the East Coast.  It was Audrey’s and Joan’s idea to make the catalogue as a set of galley proofs with  handwritten corrections, held together with a clothespin. Because the art would be so new  to Philadelphia, they made the catalogue into a dictionary, with quotes from the artists  and definitions of words that were common in the art world. One morning within 20  minutes I produced definitions of words I believed relevant: for example, “look v. the  thing to do.” Allan Kaprow wrote the art historical definitions. I thought it would be a  neat idea for my definitions to be signed BK and his be signed AK. But when Allan saw  what I had written, he thought they were not serious enough and refused to sign his  contributions to the dictionary.",378

She of course  picked up on the idea and together with Alan Solomon of the Jewish Museum organized  the Popular Image Exhibition which opened April 18, 1963.  
 Underneath the table in my laboratory I had an old reel-to-reel tape recorder which I  began lugging around to the artists in the exhibition and taped interviews with them. I cut  the tapes by hand on my dining room table and produced an LP record of the interviews  at Columbia Records. I later found out that these were the first taped interviews many of  these artists ever made. Andy made what was his first silkscreen for the record cover,  Giant Size 1.57. I helped him by laying out more than 100 record covers on the floor in  the fire house on East 47th street. First we sprayed them in different day-glo colors and  then silkscreened the text in black.",245
Story of E.A.T. Part I,Q24646,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: During the time I was working with Tinguely on Homage to New York, Robert  Rauschenberg asked me to collaborate on what he described as an interactive  environment. After many discussions, the idea boiled down to a sound environment  where the sounds from five AM radios emanate from five sculptures. The viewer can  vary the volume and the rate of scanning through the frequency band from knobs on the  control unit, but cannot stop the scanning at any one station. Rauschenberg wanted no  wires from the control unit to the other pieces, so that they could all be moved freely in  relation to one another. With the limited technology available in the early 1960’s, we  designed and built a system where all the AM radios were located in the control unit and  the sound was re-transmitted on the FM band to receivers and speakers in the other  pieces. Interference between the FM transmitters and noise from the scanning motors  were problems we had to solve. In this photograph Rauschenberg and I are working on  Oracle.",235
Story of E.A.T. Part I,Q24647,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: When Harold Hodges and I were finishing the technical system, Rauschenberg put  together the five sculptures that make up Oracle from objects he found in the streets. The  pieces consist of a car door mounted on a typewriter table; a tub with an air conditioning  duct through which water flows with a small wire basket attached to the tub by a chain; a  window frame attached to another long duct; an exhaust pipe on large wheels; and a large  aluminum staircase which houses the control unit. I had ordered the aluminum staircase  according to Bob’s specs, and he added other objects to it. Bob located the speakers in  each piece so that the piece had its own unique sound.  
 Oracle was shown at Leo Castelli Gallery, on May 15, 1965. To avoid the feeling of a  gallery, Rauschenberg covered the floor with a black rubber mat. The five pieces were  placed throughout the front room of the gallery and the viewers could walk freely among  them.",221

Story of E.A.T. Part I,Q24650,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: By 1965, interest among the artists in using technology had grown, and many of the  artists who had performed together at Judson Church and other spaces in New York  expressed a desire to stage large-scale performances. Bob Rauschenberg and I organized  a group of artists to work together with engineers on a series of performances involving  new technology. The group included John Cage, Lucinda Childs, Öyvind Fahlström,  Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, David  Tudor, and Robert Whitman. The first planning meeting of artists and engineers took  place in early 1966 in Rauschenberg’s studio. During the summer of 1966, more than 30  engineers, most of them from Bell Laboratories, worked in one-to-one collaboration with  individual artists, depending on the artist’s project and engineer’s speciality.

He  and David Tudor settled on two systems for the sound to be affected by movement. For  the first, my colleagues and I set up a system of directional photocells aimed at the stage  lights, so that the dancers triggered sounds as they cut the light beams with their  movements. A second system used a series of antennas. When a dancer came within four  feet of an antenna a sound would result. Ten photocells were wired to activate tape recorders and short-wave radios. Cecil Coker designed a control circuit, which was built  by my assistant Witt Wittnebert. Film footage by Stan VanDerBeek and Nam June Paik’s  manipulated television images were projected on screens behind the dancers. In this  photograph Variations V is performed for a television taping session in Hamburg. The  photocells were located at the base of the five-foot antennas placed around the stage.

We made  some calculations and discovered it was not possible with existing battery technology.  While working on the idea, my colleague at Bell Laboratories found a material called  Scotchpak™ which was relatively impermeable to helium and could be heat sealed. It  
 was used by the United States Army for wrapping sandwiches. When I brought this  material to Andy he decided to make clouds and while we were figuring out how to heat seal curves, he simply folded the material over and made these Silver Clouds, which were  first shown at Leo Castelli’s gallery in 1966. The sculptures had a wonderful buoyancy  as they hovered gently in the room. The heat gradient between the floor and ceiling  creates a slight pressure differential; we could balance the Silver Clouds using paperclips  to make them float between ceiling and floor.",201

Each time Frank Stella and  Mimi Kanarek hit the ball the vibrations of the racquet strings were transmitted to the  speakers around the armory, and a loud BONG was heard. At each BONG, one of the 48  lights went out, and the game ended when the Armory was in complete darkness. Five  hundred people came on stage in the dark. Using infrared light and infrared television  cameras, their images were picked up and projected on three large screens suspended in  front of the audience.

Part II,Q24735,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: In September of 1968 Robert Breer introduced us to his neighbor, David Thomas of Pepsi Cola, who proposed that artists be involved in designing the Pepsi Pavilion for Expo ‘70  in Osaka, Japan. Breer and I chose Frosty Myers, Robert Whitman, and David Tudor to  collaborate on the design of the Pavilion. As the design of the Pavilion developed, engineers and more artists were added to the project and given responsibility to develop specific elements. All in all 63 engineers, artists and scientists contributed to the design of the Pavilion.  
 Outside the Pavilion, the dome, which had been decided on before we came into the project, was covered by a water vapor cloud sculpture, by Fujiko Nakaya. And on the plaza, seven of Robert Breer’s Floats, six-foot high white sculptures, moved around slowly at less than 2 feet per minute, emitting sound. Four tall triangular towers held the lights for Myers’ Light Frame sculpture.",213
Story of E.A.T. Part II,Q24732,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: The initial effort of E.A.T. in 1967 and 1968 was to generate publicity and contacts in order to recruit engineers to work with artists and to raise money for the operation of E.A.T. We arranged for artists to visit technical laboratories like Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., IBM Laboratories in Armonk, N.Y., and RCA Sarnoff Laboratories in Princeton, N.J. We held a weekly open house at the E.A.T. loft, where artists and  engineers could meet and talk informally. In March 1967 we took a booth at the annual meeting of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) where artists made the case for engineers getting involved. In this photograph artists Tom Gormley and Hans Haacke, far right, are talking to an engineer. Our recruiting efforts were successful. Within three years, in addition to 2,000 artist members, we had more than 2,000 engineer members all over the country. This made it possible to carry out our goal of responding to every artist who required technical help and matching the artists with engineers who could collaborate with them on ideas the artists couldn’t execute by themselves.",259

Part II,Q24733,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: Again to stimulate interest in the technical community, E.A.T., in November 1967, announced a competition for the best contribution by an engineer to a work of art made in  collaboration with an artist. The prize was to be given to the engineer, and the judges  were all engineers.  
 Some of the works were to be selected by Pontus Hulten for his exhibition, “The  Machine,” at the Museum of Modern Art in 1968. E.A.T. offered to find partners for all engineers and artists who wanted to enter the competition.",134
Story of E.A.T. Part II,Q24738,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: The original four artists wanted to cover the dome, which had been decided on before we became involved, with a cloud and asked Japanese artist Fujiko Nakaya to create it. We had already rejected chemical means of producing fog: carbon dioxide for environmental reasons and urea for public relations ones. Nakaya found cloud physicist Tom Mee in Pasadena, who designed a nozzle system for her. Water under pressure of 500 psi is pushed through an orifice 10 mil in diameter and hits a small pin which breaks the water into droplets tiny enough to remain suspended in air. The system for the Pavilion consisted of 2,520 jet-spray nozzles organized in 10-foot strands of plastic pipe with one  nozzle every foot, placed in the ridges and valleys on the top section of the roof. The system could generate a 6-foot thick 150-foot diameter area of low-hanging cloud. This required 41 tons of water per hour, and we had to build a small reservoir to continually feed the system. Nakaya took this photograph the first day she had the cloud system turned on full. The Expo fire brigade showed up, but much to their relief found only what  they called ‘water smoke.’",261

Climbing the stairs, they came into the Mirror Dome, which was Bob Whitman’s idea. It was a 90-foot diameter 210-degree spherical mirror made of aluminized mylar in which the real image of the floor and the visitors on it hung upside down in space over the their heads. David Tudor designed the sound system as an “instrument” with 32 input channels and 37 speakers arranged in a rhombic grid on the surface of the dome behind the mirror. Sound could be moved at varying speeds around or across the dome, or it could be shifted abruptly from any one speaker to another, creating point sources of sound. Both the lighting system, designed by artist Tony Martin, and the sound system could be pre programed or controlled in real time from a console at one side of the Dome. The artists wanted to create a Pavilion where the vistors could explore the enviornment and create their own experience. The artists also conceived of the Pavilion as a  performance space, continuously programmed by visiting American and Japanese artists throughout the six months of Expo ‘70.",272

It was dark, with some light coming from the glass ceiling which was the center part of the floor of the Mirror Dome. A sound-activated laser deflection system showered the floor and visitors with moving patterns of laser light 10 feet across. Lowell Cross designed the system which split the beam from a krypton laser into four colors, and sent each color beam to sets of mirrors mounted at right angles and vibrating up to 500 cycles per second  to create the patterns.

But nobody had ever looked inside a mirror of this size. Elsa Garmire calculated the properties of such a mirror and to test these optical effects and demonstrate them to skeptical Pepsi executives, we decided to build a full- scale model of the mirror. E.A.T.-Los Angeles, under the direction of David McDermott and Ardison Phillips, had been investigating air structures and organized the installation of the 90-foot diameter mirror in a former dirigible hangar at the Marine Air Corps Station at Santa Ana, just south of Los Angeles.  The mirror ripped as they were inflating it, but Ardison simply put it back in its box and sent it to Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, where it was repaired and successfully installed a few weeks later. The effects were spectacular, and we held a press conference and great party for the artists and Pepsi executives. Because of its experience in building the ECHO and PAGEOS satellites and its ability to hold the optical tolerances we needed, the final mirror was manufactured by G.T. Schjeldahl of Northfield, Minnesota.",264

Part II,Q24741,"The Story of E.A.T. by Billy Kluver: The spherical mirror in the Pepsi Pavilion, showing the real image of the floor and the visitors hanging upside down in space over their heads. This optical effect resembles that of a hologram. Because of the size of our mirror, a spectator looking at the real image of a person could walk around that image and see it from all sides. The effect was  spectacular.  
 Our architect John Pearce devised an ingenious way the mylar mirror could be held up inside an air-tight spherical cage. A slight vacuum of less than 1/1000 of an atmosphere in the space between the cage and the mirror was sufficient to hold up the mirror. There was no need for cumbersome air locks.  
 The floor was divided into 10 areas made up of different materials, such as astroturf, rough wood, slate, tile, and asphalt. Through handsets, visitors could hear different sounds while standing on each different floor material: on the tile floor, horses hooves and shattering glass; on the astroturf, ducks, frogs, cicadas and lions roaring. These sounds were transmitted to the handset from wire loops embedded in the floor section.",248

The group went to India in December 1969 and worked at the Anand Dairy Cooperative in Gujurat State to produce programs for the women who raise buffalo for milk production. We proposed using 1/2” video equipment to gather material from the villages which would be used as visual research notes when the final instructional programs would be made for broadcast over the satellite.

Four triangular poles of different heights, were set in a square 130 feet apart at each corner of the Pavilion plaza. At the top of each pole were two 500-watt, high intensity xenon lights, each light directed toward  the light of the neighboring tower, creating a narrow beam of light between each tower to form the rectangle of light.  
 The number of technical breakthroughs in the Pavilion was quite astonishing: the cloud system, the 90-foot diameter spherical mirror, the xenon light frame, the sound loops in  the floor, and the design of the control console. Almost everything we did was new and untried. But even more significant was that the Pavilion was a living, responsive environment: The Cloud and the Floats on the exterior were always moving, and inside the sound, lights and images in the mirror were always changing as people entered and explored it.

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20468,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, what happened was after 9 Evenings they decided to find out whether this was something that was interesting to the art community in general—interesting to the artists in New York. There was an enormous amount of interest in the 9 Evenings. A lot of artists got involved helping their friends, and were part of it and came to it. Marcel Duchamp even came. Chuck Close remembers sitting next to him at one of the performance evenings. So the artists and engineers decided to hold a meeting for artists and put out the word—invited artists to come to a meeting at the Broadway Central Hotel [New York]. The artists and the engineers who had participated in 9 Evenings spoke and talked about their experience and asked the audience, “Is this something that’s interesting?” About three hundred people attended the meeting and there were something like eighty requests right away for projects that artists needed help for. So the response from the art community was quite large and spontaneous and the interest in working with engineers was also large. So really from the beginning the ideas for what E.A.T. would do and be went beyond just using the equipment from 9 Evenings.
 The early working out of what E.A.T. would do was, I think, an attempt to respond to the expressed needs of the artists whom they had contact with combined with the more general ideas about the societal possibilities inherent in the artist-engineer collaborations that inspired all four founders of E.A.T. It represented the coming together of the larger ideas that Billy had had since the early sixties about the artist being able to invigorate engineers’ ideas about their own work, with Bob R.’s ideas of the value of the collaboration to close a gap—the isolation of the two communities from each other. For both Whitman and Rauschenberg you had the understanding of the need for the artist to work with new technology—to participate in the developing technological society—and Fred recognized the value of the artist working with engineers who were developing the technology that was increasingly surrounding us. As Billy and Bob R. began to write about the organization—its goals, its structure, and its activities in the first newsletters, they articulated the larger goals: a joint statement in the second E.A.T. News ended with the sentence—let me read it—“E.A.T. is founded on the strong belief that an industrially sponsored, effective working relationship between artists and engineers will lead to new possibilities which will benefit society as a whole.”
 In terms of the organization of E.A.T., I think they were working it out as they went along. In the first newsletter, they wrote that setting up the organization would rely on the “experience derived during the formative period.” And then in a sentence that I’m convinced was largely Bob’s, “The thought behind E.A.T. is that the organization should be generous, adaptable, and helpful.” So then, responding to the artists’ requests, the practical activities of E.A.T. in the early years was to begin to recruit engineers—to find engineers who wanted to work with artists. And then that was going to be the main ongoing effort of the organization, matching artists and engineers to work on the artists’ projects.
 I also want to say that the response was not only from the New York artists but we began to be contacted by artists and engineers around the country who wanted to form E.A.T. local groups. So we said go ahead, and tried to give them advice on ideas and activities we had developed. You could say the idea of artists and engineers working together was an idea whose time had come.",779
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20469,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, I think once E.A.T. was founded, the officers were: Billy was president, Bob R. was vice president, Fred was secretary, and Whitman was treasurer. Later, when Billy joined E.A.T. full-time, then Bob R. became chairman of the board. But these titles didn’t mean much because everyone worked together.",83
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20474,"Q: And the newsletter, the idea of it was to, once you had this network—putting artists in touch with engineers—it becomes a vehicle of keeping that network in communication. Was that the idea?",43
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20475,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. I mean, the early days, it was mostly about E.A.T.—the plans, ongoing activities like talks at industries, open houses, what we were doing, asking people to sign up as members. I know there’s a very funny notice where Billy says, “Would you please fill out the artist’s application slip? Little names on little pieces of paper are not too easy for our engineers to decipher.” So it was getting the organization going and articulating what should be done. He and Bob worked very closely together on a lot of these things. Billy always trusted Bob’s aesthetics, so to speak, or his operational aesthetics. In the first three issues of E.A.T. News they wrote the goals of E.A.T. and in the first months hammered out ideas of collaboration and what the organization would concentrate on. Billy very much collaborated with him or would ask him, “This? Should we do this? Should we do this?” He would ask Bob to design the heading of the E.A.T. News. Bob chose the E.A.T. font. “How should we do it?” This kind of thing. They worked closely together on this I think.",268
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20478,"An interview with Julie Martin: I’m really not good at this. I think the thing about Bob is incredible directness, straightforward. I mean, he would make a comment about something and he’d be right on. And he didn’t let you get away with any bullshit. He would—his comments or reactions to things that could just turn it just a little bit so you saw another side of it or you saw it clearer or you saw a way to do something clearer. He had very little patience for obstacles or people trying to put obstacles in your way. He was funny, amazing humor, amazing storyteller when he got going. But when he focused, the focus was absolutely right on. Working with him was extraordinarily easy and quite fulfilling.",157

But I think there were people around a lot but I’m not sure there were extra people around when he was working. But you can talk to people who worked with him. But when he was not working, he was—the TV was always on, not always the sound. People would come. He liked to sit around and talk and he was interested in people, interested in new people.",114
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20476,"Q: Well, I wanted to talk more specifically about Bob Rauschenberg and some general memories of his personality and then to go through some of the stuff we were talking about over email about the later projects. But if you could just give us—it doesn’t have to be specific anecdotes—but your sense of him as a person. So here’s someone—imagine you’re describing him to me. I never met Bob Rauschenberg. What was he like? What was it like to be in the room with him? What was his personality like?",121
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20477,"Q: It seems he must have been driven and focused because he produced such an enormous amount in such a remarkable range of media. But he seems to have been a really socially remarkable figure, too. He wasn’t a recluse who goes into the studio and shuts the door. He seems to have been so open to interaction and collaboration and hanging out with people, working with other people. Is that an accurate impression? Is that the way you’d describe him?",97
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20482,"Q: I think it’s with Solstice—I remember a comment, I think in the piece you co-wrote with Billy about his decisiveness, that Rauschenberg, when it became time to put the images on the doors, that they were stunned by how quickly Rauschenberg says, “Okay, I need to do twenty”— however many it was—“I need to do twenty-four and these are going to be the”—just laid them out in an afternoon.",109
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20483,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think the collaboration was more you’d talk together, decide what you wanted to do and then the engineer would go off and build something they had talked about. I mean, I know that Robby Robinson talks about, in the article that Billy wrote about Solstice, that Bob said, “I want this, I have a certain idea.” And then Robby remembered the doors at Amsterdam airport and suggested that. They suggested things, suggested how to carry out Bob’s initial ideas. But once it was about building it, once they decided on it, then maybe the engineer would build something to a certain point and then come back to Bob. But I don’t think Bob was there soldering, for example. But of course, later, when he was making his prints he was very hands- on. Again, you’d have to talk to people who worked with him because I really didn’t. But I think with the engineering, Bob very much let the engineer do their part and then he would see it. And Billy always wanted to check with Bob, “Is this all right?” Particularly when the time for restorations or renovations came. You know, Per Biorn would build something and then he or Billy would make sure it was all right. Or, “How do you want it?”",287
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20480,"Q: And in terms of the collaborative aspect, just to go back to that, what we were talking about before was his idea that you would be in the same room working on projects together, calling over every few minutes, “Oh, look at this.” Or was it that he would say to Billy, “Go off and do this and go do it on your own and come back a week later with something?” Was collaboration actually working together, or was it go off and do your thing and I’ll do mine?",113
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20481,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. The first thing they did was to get an office. They rented a loft on the sixth floor of a building at 9 East Sixteenth Street. It was 5,000 square feet, so it was really huge. So they built a small space in the front southwest corner, toward the front windows, and that was the administrative office. And then they put a wall maybe a third of the way up from the back windows with a fairly large opening and back there was the technical part. Ralph Flynn, who had been a TA at Bell Labs, came to work full-time for E.A.T. as their technical director, helping artists with loans of equipment and with simple technical problems. Carolee Schneemann borrowed some for her piece Snows. Max Neuhaus was there, I know. So they lent stuff to different people. Then the middle space was left open as a meeting room. We began to have open houses on Sunday so artists and engineers could come together and talk. Just meet and begin to talk. Then we organized a series of lectures for artists on technology in the main space. So that was it. That was the office up until 1969, when we moved the administrative offices to 235 Park Avenue South when we took on the Pepsi Pavilion project. We still kept the loft on Sixteenth Street and some of the equipment for the Pavilion was designed and built there.",288
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20486,"An interview with Julie Martin: Apparently. I mean, I didn’t remember exactly when I started but the first E.A.T. News on which I’m listed as editor was published November 1, 1967. I had been working for television. When I finally left Columbia—I got my master’s in the fall of 1965—and I worked for CBC [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation] in Ottawa on a program on the Russian Revolution from winter ’66 to spring ’67 and then in fall 1967 at Channel Thirteen, also on a program on the Russian Revolution. During the spring of 1967, I was at CBS, where I worked on a program called “The Walls Come Tumbling Down,” a documentary on several contemporary artists, including Tony Smith and Marta Minujín, an Argentinean artist who was working with
 E.A.T. engineer Per Biorn on an interactive telephone booth she called the Minuphone. Another of the segments was on Rauschenberg and they filmed in the chapel at 381 when the Revolvers were delivered to him from the fabricator and he and Brice Marden, his assistant at the time, were looking at them assembled and working for the first time. Somehow later I got hold of that piece of film and it’s now in the Foundation’s archives.
 So I guess Billy and Fred knew what I’d done from the 9 Evenings, helping Pontus with the program and then later helping Simone with her article for Artforum. I joke and say that most artists are terrible spellers and they knew that I could spell so I had a rare skill to contribute. So they asked me to come and join E.A.T. as editor of the newsletter. And so I did and worked on the newsletter and then more publications like the Some More Beginnings catalogue and Techne, which was a more general publication, which we published when we split E.A.T. News into two parts: Techne, which we called a “projects and process paper,” and E.A.T. Information and Operations, with news and information for artist and engineer members. Techne was the Greek word that meant thought put into practice, practical application of knowledge. I think Billy thought techne could refer to both art and technology, and the subtitle “projects and process” emphasized the commitment to active collaborations in the world. We put out two issues of Techne, which published news about E.A.T. and some of the artists’ projects but also had articles about everything from [Gottfried Wilhelm von] Leibniz’s ideas for an exposition of marvelous machines, to an interview with Claes Oldenburg, to some artists’ projects that might interest engineers to figure out, like [Peter] Pete Seeger’s request for a tunable steel drum, or a paint that youngsters could use to paint on buildings that would disappear in cold weather. It was in this projects section of Techne that we published Bob R.’s suggestions, almost a manifesto, for neighborhood cultural activities. During this time, the Pepsi Pavilion project started and I stayed on to work on general projects through the years.",668
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20487,"Q: Would you say that these qualities that you’re sketching for us are ones that Billy had, too? I wonder about the depth of their relationship. Because Billy worked with a number of artists.
 With Warhol and Jasper Johns. But my impression is that his relationship with Rauschenberg was especially close and continued over decades. What was the glue of their relationship? What did they like about each other? Why did they get along so well?",95
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20484,Q: The other element of his personality that you had mentioned to me that you thought you could say something about was his generosity. And you were talking about a particular episode in the 1970s. So I wanted to ask you to recount that story.,50
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20485,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, that was his job, in the sense that Bob did know visually what he wanted to do and he probably had the idea for a long time. That was his part of it. But he didn’t interfere or have anything to do with the building of the frame or the moving mechanism of Solstice until it was ready. And then he did his part and I’m sure he knew that he wanted to do some of those color separations of one image on each panel so when the doors opened and closed, you got a four- color image appearing and disappearing, et cetera, et cetera. Of course, to the engineers, that’s amazing to be able to do the silkscreening that fast.",159
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20488,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think Bob’s generosity in terms of not only helping friend—which he did, I think, a lot, but other people can talk about that—his support for E.A.T. and his support for what Billy and the others were doing was constant. You could always come to him. You could talk to him. You could ask him. So it wasn’t just money or things. He was available and if you had an issue, he would listen, and his take on situations was extraordinarily clear and extraordinarily helpful.
 I was thinking about what I hadn’t mentioned to you during the other interview. When we did the New York Collection for Stockholm in order to buy the works from the artists and then donate them to Moderna Museet we needed to find a way to raise funds—because it got harder to raise money when the collection was going to a foreign museum. The artists were totally in favor of it but it became more abstract for American patrons. Billy and Bob came up with the idea of a portfolio of prints. We asked each of the thirty artists in the collection to donate a print to a portfolio and the prints were made. At a certain point, Adi Rischner needed to be paid. And so there were about twenty-seven portfolios, maybe more, that hadn’t been sold. So we started talking to a collector couple in Philadelphia about the possibility of their buying it quite inexpensively, et cetera. But they began to make all these conditions—this, that. Bob just got angry. He said, “Forget it. I’m buying them.” He bought them and Adi got paid. Then he wanted to donate them—all of them—to different museums and universities. He asked me to find the places to give them to, which was really great. So I found university museums, colleges, smaller museums, to receive the portfolios, which were great teaching portfolios, with so many artists in it. So it was that kind of thing he just didn’t want to put up with. He didn’t want money or irrelevancies to get in the way of doing something. When you’re committed to do it, you do it.
 Then of course, when he could, he started Change, Inc., which was to provide emergency funds to artists for finishing work for a show or for a medical emergency and it operated with no bureaucracy. As the funding people were getting more and more bureaucratic, his organization asked the artists only to say, “I’m an artist, here are my slides, I need X to do a show,” and if the money was there, the artist got what was needed. So Change, Inc. had this kind of very direct, hands-on—generosity.
 [Note: Change, Inc., founded in 1970, provided small sums of money to artists for non-art emergency expenses such as rent and medical costs.]
 [INTERRUPTION]
 Bob’s generosity. I was talking about Change, Incorporated and the fact that it was very direct. If an artist had an issue with health or was trying to finish a piece or finish something for an exhibition, they could apply and there was no paperwork. “I’m an artist, here are my slides, I need X,” and then if the money was there, the artist got it. So this kind of generosity but with no fancy stuff around it.
 Then, of course, he founded the Rauschenberg Foundation and I believe expanded the causes he gave money to. And of course, Bob made posters—an enormous amount of posters for events and causes throughout his life. This kind of donating work, but also making statements, using his art to make statements. I think his interest in E.A.T. was very much that—the idea that art and artists can make a difference. Working with Billy and then the experience of 9 Evenings and his experience working with engineers on the works he made incorporating technology, he understood that the artist-engineer collaboration can let you make art that can make a difference in the world. This was a common thread throughout his life, finding different ways for art to make a difference.",883
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20489,"An interview with Julie Martin: Early on Billy worked with a number of artists, like Johns and Warhol and Cage and Tudor, and continued to help artists with projects all his life. But he had close and sustained relationships that went beyond working on art projects with two artists, Bob Rauschenberg and Bob Whitman. Both of these relationships developed in the context of E.A.T. and then continued throughout their lives. The basis for these relationships was a moral sense—a commitment to the role of art and artist to contribute to the common good in society. My favorite words: commitment, responsibility, the individual.",126
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20495,"Q: I had a couple of other small questions and then we can try to talk about politics. Just thinking, moving from the sixties into the seventies, how would you evaluate the impact of E.A.T. on the art scene? Do you feel like it reverberated out and had a real impact on the way visual artists and performers thought about what they were doing?",78
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20492,"An interview with Julie Martin: Oh, right. There’s a Japanese artist, Fujiko Nakaya, whom Bob met when he traveled with Merce to Japan during the world tour in ’64. She spoke English and was an artist and very well-connected in the art community in Japan and she was very active in helping them negotiate Japan in those days. So when we were ready to go to Japan for the first time—Billy and the four artists who were designing the Pepsi Pavilion—he told them to look up Fujiko. She’d help them out. So they did and it turned out that she was working with fog, making little fog sculptures.
 From the beginning the artists had wanted to cover the pavilion with fog. We had been given the dome-shaped building and they all hated what it looked like so they were trying to cover it with fog. We had had some amusing tries in the U.S., like using urea—uric acid fog—or dry ice fog, which would have attracted every mosquito in Japan to the pavilion. So when Billy and the artists heard Fujiko talk about her work, they all turned to her and asked her whether she would make a fog sculpture covering the building. And she said yes. So she undertook that project, worked with Japanese meteorologists, and she and Billy finally found a person who had invented a nozzle, which, under pressure, could break up the water in droplets small enough to hang in the air—that is, to make pure water vapor fog. It was a physicist, Tom Mee, in Pasadena, actually.
 He had invented this nozzle but had virtually given up on it, not finding any uses for fog-making.
 E.A.T. and Fujiko commissioned him to develop the system for the pavilion. It used 2,500 nozzles in pipes that were attached to the ridges and valleys of the dome. Fujiko has continued to work with fog ever since. In ’97 Bob went to Japan to accept one of those reat prizes, the emperor’s prize. [Note: Rauschenberg received the Praemium Imperiale for Painting, Japan Art Association, Tokyo in 1998.] He was having dinner with Fujiko—she is this amazing cook—and he asked, “How are you doing? What are you working on?” She said, “Well, I’m doing fog sculptures but I have to have a commission in order to do something that big.” Bob immediately said, “I commission you to make a fog sculpture for my opening in Bilbao—it’s in two months.” And as Fujiko tells the story she said to herself, “It’s impossible.” But to Bob, of course, she said, “Yes.” She worked with a fog-making company in Switzerland, visited the site, made wind measurements, and decided where to place the strands of fog-producing nozzles. She placed the strands of nozzles under the bridge at the back of the lake behind the building. At the opening, this incredible, beautiful fog rolled across the lake in back of the building, rolled across the lake climbing the back wall of the building. Sometimes, when the wind changed, the fog bank would roll the other way and float down the river. It was there for the opening and then Bob bought the sculpture and donated it to Bilbao. So it’s permanently installed there. At one point, I guess the day after the opening, Fujiko said she was talking to Bob and Bob says, “You realize you’ve made a fog, F. O. G. “And she said, “Oh, my god—Frank O. Gehry.” She hadn’t seen that but of course Bob did immediately.",803
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20498,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think the artists who were interested in using technology were interested in using technology. So it made a difference that they began to have access to engineers who could work with them. I mean, art and technology was never an art movement with a recognizable look like Minimalism or Pop art. It was too varied. Some galleries concentrated on works that incorporate technology like Howard Wise [Gallery, New York], et cetera. But it wasn’t that kind of thing. From a Rauschenberg Oracle, to a Whitman Red Laser Line [1967], to a Nam June Paik television monitor with magnet piece, the works incorporating technology were too diverse. I don’t think Billy ever thought it should be an aesthetic. That wasn’t the idea. It was about collaboration, a process, a way of individuals working together. The idea was to enable the individual artist to make work that he or she wanted to make.",196
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20499,"An interview with Julie Martin: It’s programmed, I think. She programs it with off and on cycles. If there is a heavy wind, the fog just blows away. And if there is no wind or the wind blows in a certain direction it fogs all the walkways in the back of the building and it gets dangerous for people walking there. Its behavior is dependent on the weather and the off-on cycles vary the configurations it produces and no one fog cloud stays forever. It is continually changing but it’s a definite permanent fixture there. Thanks to Bob.
 I also want to talk about Bob’s support of the project to preserve the archival 16-millimeter footage that was shot at 9 Evenings and to make films of each of the artists’ performances at the 9 Evenings. Around 1995, Billy found the original 16-millimeter film footage from the 9 Evenings in his basement on the point of decay. We wanted to rescue it and use it to make reconstructions of each artist’s work at 9 Evenings. Much of the footage was in small pieces because Billy and Bob R. and Bob Whitman had worked with Alfons Schilling, who shot the footage, to make a film of 9 Evenings in 1967, using about two minutes of each performance.
 First, we worked with the filmmaker Barbro Schultz Lundestam and a rented Steenbeck [film editing machine] that sat in our living room to divide and re-assemble the film pieces into each artist’s performance, in no particular order. Then we had this film material digitized. Billy asked Bob for help and the Rauschenberg Foundation supported the digitization of the material so Barbro could begin editing the footage. A grant from Swedish sources allowed us to finish the video film on Öyvind Fahlström’s Kisses Sweeter than Wine [1966]. She and Billy then went to work on Bob’s performance. Arthur [J.] Williams at the Tape House, a high-end post-production facility, assigned us one of his editors, [Kenneth] Ken Weissman, to work on the films and also supported the online finishing of Öyvind’s film and also the film of Bob’s performance, Open Score. The film was premiered during the opening days of Bob’s retrospective at the Guggenheim in New York in 1997. When fundraising was difficult for the project, Billy asked Bob for ideas for fundraising and Bob generously offered to give E.A.T. a work to sell to finance the films. This made it possible for us to continue the project. I remember we went down to visit him in Captiva a few days after Christmas and thought we should stay over New Year’s and discovered that Bob had no feeling for that holiday and was only concerned that the fireworks and extra noise for the celebration would upset the dogs. I remember Bob talked about being invited by one of his collectors to cruise on their yacht for two weeks that winter and he said no, of course, and commented that he couldn’t imagine doing nothing for two weeks. I think Bob was never not working.
 Also, right after September 11 [2001], I got the idea that Bob could make a print or poster for a benefit that a group of artists was organizing to help artists whose studios and work had been damaged or destroyed. I had the idea that Bob would choose very positive images of New York. But of course, I didn’t say anything like that—just asked him if he’d make a print/poster for the benefit. He agreed immediately and ULAE agreed to print it. To my surprise, he had a very specific image that he wanted to realize. He wanted, very simply, a black and white image of the Twin Towers cradled in the arms of the Statue of Liberty [I Love New York, 2001]. Of course, it was an extremely moving idea combining elegy, comfort, and hope. But I remember it was almost impossible to get an image of the Twin Towers good enough for printing. I remember trying to contact the public information department of the Port Authority [of New York and New Jersey] but of course they had more important survival things on their minds. Finally I found something and I believe that [Laurence] Laury Getford or someone else in Captiva had to digitally restore the base of the image of the towers. And Bob was able to realize what he wanted to convey.",928
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20497,"An interview with Julie Martin: I don’t think Billy thought—no, in the beginning, it’s not the art itself. I think for Billy, it really wasn’t about the art. I mean, he worked with these really wonderful artists and good artists and the value of art was there but, as E.A.T. developed, anyway, it was more the process of people working together on projects—and projects that were not necessarily art but the artist coming out into the society, going even further than his art. So I think there could have been— there was a little bit of that kind of difference. I mean, they didn’t argue about it. But I think in terms of projects that—Bob didn’t become part of the Pepsi Pavilion. He came to one of the early meetings and made some suggestions and some ideas. When he heard many of the ideas the four core artists were coming up with, he saw there were many visual elements and he suggested thinking of an invisible environment with less objects or architecture but other elements of sound, light, et cetera—even suggesting a shallow pool in the middle of the floor that visitors would be invited to wade in. That got the other artists thinking. And Whitman, who had worked with mirrors and worked with large mirrors had sort of pushed things in that direction and that became a feature of a kind of invisible but very rich environment that people could experience on their own and compose their own experience. For all the artists it was important that the viewer could compose his or her own experience. They could listen to the sounds from the floor, they looked in the mirror, they could interact with the mirror, they could watch a performance there, but they would see it from different points of view. They would see themselves from different points of view. But also all four of the core artists didn’t want anything fixed or set like Disney, where you would ride in a little car through a fixed environment. No, the idea of all the four core artists for the pavilion was to have a really rich environment that the people interacted with. The pavilion started with an idea—with a concern for the individual’s experience there.",455
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20503,"Q: I think what you just said was really useful and that’s to say that politics is very much there. But the other thing that you brought up was his use of language, both in terms of his titles and his writings. I was reading through some of his writings here in the archive.",62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20500,"Q: And so you meant that, as we move into the seventies—not a break but maybe a fork in the path—it’s that Billy really is moving towards that Projects Outside Art idea, whereas Bob is more focused on the art world. Is that the way you’d put it?",64
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20504,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, except that with Bob it was never just one thing going on at a time because at the same time, from 1971 to 1973, they did the New York Collection for Stockholm project. I mean, Bob was still involved. I think he was no longer chairman of the board of directors. He decided he had other commitments. But when we started to do the New York Collection for Stockholm, he was very present in that and was part of so many of the decisions. When we decided to make a portfolio, the idea was let’s make the prints small; the prints are 9 by 12 inches. And we started out saying only black-and-white, or as Whitman put it, one-strike prints. But of course, once the artists got started, the prints were all over the place. Segal made a record and Andy Warhol a photocopy print that used the copy made by the machine as the original for the next print. And the image, a drawing of Mao, changed radically over the edition. Bob’s print was a preparatory drawing he had made for the Combine, Monogram, which Billy had encouraged him to sell to Moderna Museet and which the museum acquired in 1964. [Note: lithograph and two-color screenprint for the portfolio titled Sketch for Monogram, 1959, 1973] The New York Collection portfolio was to be housed in a Honduras mahogany box, built by Peter Ballantine, who worked in wood for Donald Judd. But soon Honduras mahogany became scarce and was declared an endangered wood. So Bob helped design a cardboard slipcase for the portfolio, choosing the material and colors.
 So it wasn’t a break. I don’t think there’s a break. I mean, E.A.T., again—less funding, we weren’t as active, et cetera—so there wasn’t as much to do.
 But certainly with the New York Collection, Bob was right there when we held the dinner in 1972 for Princess Christina of Sweden who was a patroness of the collection. We organized a showing of the works in the collection at the Castelli, [Ileana] Sonnabend, and John Weber galleries at 420 West Broadway, followed by a dinner at Bob’s place at 381 Lafayette in her honor. For the opening of the New York Collection for Stockholm at Moderna Museet a year later, we organized a charter flight for the artists and patrons of the collection and of course, Bob came on that flight with us. He came to Sweden, he was part of it. So it varied.
 But I do think there are two—they’re slightly different. I think Bob really did believe in this. And I don’t say Billy didn’t believe in the power of art—that’s not what I’m saying—but the focus was on getting the people together to make the art. And Bob, as he began to make more and more of his art and then use it in different ways, this idea that it really could change people. Well, with ROCI in particular, he used his art, and showing his art in the different countries, to change people’s ideas. I mean, both of them were part of, I think, this incredible utopian excitement of the sixties. I mean, the sixties began—it began in politics as well. You know, the Civil Rights movement and anti–Vietnam War movement, Students for a Democratic Society too. But this idea that we really can change things—the whole thing—all of these groups really felt they could change the society for the better. I think E.A.T. was very much part of that. And the ideas of it—it wasn’t about putting lights in sculptures. It was really about changing the society. I think that Billy and Bob shared this. And each one continued to do it in his own way.",830

 Experiments in Art and Technology is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization formed out of the collaborative effort that resulted in the ""9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering"" at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York City in October 1966. The ""9 Evenings"" was the culmination of ten months interaction between 40 engineers and l0 artists. As a result, equipment was designed and built for ten new theatre, dance and music works, and was viewed by an audience of 10,000. The UNIQUE equipment was designed and built at a cost of $35,000, not counting THE [a large portion of] contributed [help] MAN HOURS. [It] THIS EQUIPMENT is now the property of E.A.T. and is being made available to other artists. M.I.T. Technology Press will publish a book on ""9 Evenings"". A [30] 25 minute film of the performance is also available.
 In December 1966 a meeting was announced to artists in New York City to find out if E.A.T. could act as an organization for bringing artists closer to the technical world. Over 300 artists, critics and engineers participated in this meeting. Seventy-five artists had immediate technical problems. Since then, E.A.T has received 300 applications from artists ALL OVER THE WORLD with [technical] projects, INVOLVING TECH [all over the world]. 
 The interest in E.A.T. has not been limited to the artistic community. Numerous educators, universities and individuals have expressed their interest AND SUPPORT. Тo keep everyone informed of the progress, [in establishing E.A.T.,] a newsletter is published.
 The program and organization of E.A.T. has developed out of some 10,000 hours ENGINEERING experience from ""9 Evenings"" and subsequent artist-engineer collaborations.
 A grant of $8000 has been given to E.A.T. by the New York State Council on the Arts to cover initial administrative expenses.
 An agreement has been entered into with the American Foundation on Automation and Employment in which E.A.T. will receive executive office space FACILITIES in the Foundation's new building at 49 East 68th Street.

A76 E.A.T. booklet,Q23622,"RAISON D'ETRE

The purpose of Experiments in Art and Technology is to assist and catalyze the inevitable active cooperation of industry, labor, technology and the arts. E.A.T. has assumed the responsibility of developing an effective method for collaboration between artists and engineers with industrial sponsorship.

The collaboration of artist and engineer under industrial sanction emerges as a revolutionary contemporary process. Artists and engineers are becoming aware of their crucial role in changing the human environment and the relevant forces shaping our society. Engineers are aware that the artists' insight can influence his direction and give human scale to his work, and the artist recognizes richness, variety and human necessity as qualities of the new technology.

The raison d'etre of E.A.T. is the possibility of a work which is not the preconception of either the engineer, the artist or industry but a result of the exploration of the human interaction between these three areas.

",193
A76 E.A.T. booklet,Q23623,"BACKGROUND

Experiments in Art and Technology is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization formed out of the collaborative effort that resulted in the ""9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering"" at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York City in October 1966. The ""9 Evenings"" was the culmination of ten months interaction between 40 engineers and 10 artists. As a result, equipment was designed and built for ten new theatre, dance and music works, and was viewed by an audience of 10,000. The unique equipment was designed and built at a cost of $35,000, not counting the contributed man hours. This equipment is now the property of E.A.T. and is made available to other artists. M.I.T. Technology Press will publish a book on ""9 Evenings"". A 25 minute film of the performance is also available.

In December 1966 a meeting was announced to artists in New York City to inquire if E.A.T. could act as an organization for bringing artists closer to the technical world. Over 300 artists, critics and engineers participated in this meeting. Seventy-five artists had immediate technical problems. Since then, E.A.T. has received 300 applications from artists all over the world involving technology.

Interest in E.A.T. has not been limited to the artistic community. Numerous educators, universities and individuals have expressed their interest and support. A newsletter is published to keep everyone informed of the progress.

E.A.T.'s program and organization has developed from the experience of some 10,000 engineering hours involved in ""9 Evenings"" and subsequent artist-engineer collaborations.

A grant of $8,000 has been given to E.A.T. by the New York State Council on the Arts to cover initial administrative expenses.

An agreement has been entered into with the American Foundation on Automation and Employment in which E.A.T. will receive executive office space and facilities in the Foundation's new building at 49 East 68th Street.

This modest and uncertain gap between the two worlds. It is intended to bring modern technological tools to the artist for creating new art forms and fresh insights and viewpoints to the engineer for creating a ""people-oriented"" technology. The event was celebrated at news conference ""happening"" in the six-story loft building at 381 Lafayette Street used for studio poses by Robert Rauschenberg, the avant-garde artist.

Kheel, the lawyer-labor mediator, are prime movers in the art-technology merger. ""For me,"" said Mr. Kheel, ""this is the biggest mediation I've ever undertaken."" Among the art objects on display was a large drawing of a nude generated by a computer. Masterminded by two engineers, L. D. Harmon and K. C. Knowlton, this project involved the making of a transparency from a photograph and scanning it with a device operating like a television camera. The information on the transparency was then stored on magnetic tape in the form of pulses standing for digits, with the brightness level of the picture elements represented by numbers ranging from 0 to 7. After processing all the numbers, the computer printed a drawing of micropatterns formed by clusters of symbols used in electronic design. Visitors at the studios were intrigued by a sculptural representation of a woman a shower. As droplets of from water dripped the shower-head in a white stall, moving-picture images of the woman were registered by a projector behind the stall on a sand-blasted Plexiglass panel.

 The purpose of Experiments in Art and Technology, Inc. is to catalyze the inevitable active involvement of industry, technology, and the arts. E.A.T. has assumed the responsibility of developing an effective collaborative relationship between artists and engineers.
 E.A.T. will guide the artist in achieving new art through new technology and work for the professional recognition of the engineer's technical contribution within the engineering community.
 Engineers are becoming aware of their crucial role in changing the human environment. Engineers who have become involved with artist's projects have perceived how the artist's insight can influence his directions and give human scale to his work. The artist in turn desires to create within the technological world in order to satisfy the traditional involvement of the artist with the revelant forces shaping society. The collaboration of artist and engineer emerges as a revolutionary contemporary sociological process. 
 Initially, a successful working relationship between artists and engineers will require that each operate freely within his own environment. The function of E.A.T. is to create an intersection of these environments. 
 To ensure a continued fruitful interaction between a rapidly advancing technology and the arts, E.A.T. will work for a high standard of technical innovation in collaborative projects.
 E.A.T. is founded on the strong belief that an industrially sponsored, effective working relationship between artists and engineers will lead to new possibilities which will benefit society as a whole.

Art and Science Proclaim Alliance in Avant-Garde Loft

By HENRY R. LIEBERMAN

"A113 Facsimile of “Art and Science Proclaim Alliance in Avant-Garde Loft”, The New York Times, Wednesday, October 11, 1967",Q23638,"A Natural Marriage He has advised sculptors on how to build self-exploding contraptions, helped painters add neon lights and motors to their works, and provided them with amplifiers, oscillators, synthesizers, image producers and various kinds of electronic detectors to extend their range. To Dr. Klüver, it is a natural marriage. Technology supplies new techniques the materials, new and new imagery to artist. In return, technology gets from the artist new outlooks that make it ""more human, more varied, more lifelike, if you wish."" Robert Rauschenberg, the 41-year-old soft-spoken ex-Texan who has been called an artistic enfant terrible, agrees that technology has bountiful gifts to offer the artist. Far from fearing it, he finds it an ""exciting challenge."" 

",172
"A113 Facsimile of “Art and Science Proclaim Alliance in Avant-Garde Loft”, The New York Times, Wednesday, October 11, 1967",Q23639,"'No Place Is Safe' ""If you don't accept technology you better go to another place because no place here is safe."" Asked what made technology so exciting for him, he replied: ""Nobody knows the kind of art that will be created if two or three men in diverse fields become collaborators."" About 370 artists already have written to Dr. Klüver and Mr. Rauschenberg seeking technical assistance for projects they have in mind. The letters include requests for information on synthetic fabrics, pigments, enamel finishes, translucent spheres, micro-organisms, electromagnetics, ""slow chemical destruction of objects,"" ""extending the range of sensory perception"" and an ""efficient way"" to make paintings appear and disappear. Mr. Rauschenberg himself has project in mind with a problems that he has not yet been able to solve technically. He envisages a room ""that would be responsive to weather, to people viewing it, to traffic, noise and light."" This he sees as the art of the future. ""Nobody wants to paint rotten oranges anymore,"" he said.

"A113 Facsimile of “Art and Science Proclaim Alliance in Avant-Garde Loft”, The New York Times, Wednesday, October 11, 1967",Q23636,"Rauschenberg's 'Oracle' Another sculptural construction was a sound-emitting assembly consisting of a tire, truck door, window frame, bathtub and air vent. This is Mr. Rauschenberg's ""Oracle."" Five radios are used, with the tuning dial of each being rotated by motor. Thus, each radio picks up snatches of the broadcasts of all the local radio stations. To eliminate wiring from assembly components to the central pick-up point, signals from the radios are relayed to the components by small FM transmitters. Last year an artist-engineer collaboration called ""Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineering"" left the art critics bewildered. A few visitors at the Lafayette Street show also looked with puzzlement on ""Oracle."" But the show sponsors emphasized that it was the idea of collaboration, and not a specific art work, that counts most.

"A113 Facsimile of “Art and Science Proclaim Alliance in Avant-Garde Loft”, The New York Times, Wednesday, October 11, 1967",Q23637,"Contributions Are Listed While 20 helium-filled pillows floated eerily in a two-story room called ""the Chapel,"" the need for bringing artist and technologist together was stressed in speeches by Senator Jacob K. Javits, a traditionalist who sees merit in modern art; Ralph C. Gross, president of the Commerce and Industry Association; Edwin Langsam, film projection supervisor of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company; Herman D. Kenin, head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new Scientific, Professional and Cultural Employees Council, and Dr. Warren Brodey, a psychiatrist, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A.T.& T., the International Business Machines Company, the Atlantic Richfield Corporation and various labor groups are among the organizations that have made $1,000 contributions for furthering the cooperation between artists and engineers. But Mr. Gross urged industry to enlarge ""the less than 3 cents of each corporation-contribution dollar that goes to the arts."" ""Along with its obligation to be a profit-maker for its owners, the modern business corporation has an obligation to be a good citizen in the community,"" he said. ""As a basic part of this obligation, the corporation must examine carefully its responsibility to support the arts."" In explaining the unions' interest in art and engineering, Mr. Kenin, who is head of the musicians' union, said that union members were concerned about a ""growing chasm"" between disciplines, the ""growing impersonalization"" of work and the frustrations faced by many individuals in seeking to make ""valuable contributions."" He noted that union members were also consumers, members of audiences and citizens concerned with the quality of society. The event served to dramatize a drive to win organizational support for the art-technology merger and to mark the transfer of Еxperiments in Art and Technology, Inc., a nonprofit organization of artists and engineers, to the new Automation House being prepared at 49 East 69th Street. Automation House will be the center of the American Foundation on Automation and Employment, headed by Mr. Kheel and concerned with human problems caused by automation -- notably the problem of individual ""isolation."" Dr. Brodey, who heads M.I.T.'s science camp. for underprivileged youngsters, noted that new technologies had opened large new areas of creativity. While the industrial revolution ""averaged the people,"" he said, the great strides made in science and engineering had opened ""a new potential for living in a personalized environment if we merely can think our way out of the old mass-production mentality."" He added: ""It is the artist who has the capacity to make personalized products that grow in meaning as they become more familiar. The artist has learned to use as his material the familiar that is outside the 'accepted system.' By his slight shifts, relevance and meaning emerge from the hackneyed."" Dr. Klüver, the laser specialist, stressed his belief that the art-technology merger should primarily be aimed at ""catalyzing the individual's responsibility for the new technology."" In pursuing this end, the 40-year-old scientist, a thin, blond man who came here from Sweden in 1954, has long assisted artists in developing new modes of expression.

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20368,"Q: I’m not trained as an oral historian. I’m a literature professor. But sometimes there’s a fetishism in oral history of the anecdote, of the neat little—almost like a pre-made joke with a punch line. That’s not the only way that memory works.",66
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20369,"An interview with Julie Martin: You have ideas about it. I mean, it’s my idea. Maybe, who knows if somebody else has said it? That’s not the point.",41
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20372,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes, I thought that was interesting that you were also asking people about themselves too. Not just about Bob because it’s his world as well. That’s part of him—the people he knew and the people he worked with.",56
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20383,"Q: The drummer might be playing as lyrically and melodically as the horn player or the pianist. The pianist might be playing percussion, you know?

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20381,"Q: I teach a lot of jazz and literature. I teach in the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia. There are people like Cecil Taylor and the artists of this same generation. There’s a famous journalist’s description of Cecil Taylor’s piano playing that describes it as eighty-eight tuned drums. There are people who talk about Max Roach, the drummer, as the most melodic drummer.",85
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20384,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. Exactly. It was not collaboration but Billy was involved in Black Market, in the sense that Pontus had asked Billy to be the American agent to help organize the American contribution to a show he was organizing, Art in Motion [1961]. It went first to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and then to Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Billy helped Pontus visit some of the older artists who had been involved in movement—[Naum] Gabo gave Billy his 1920 sculpture [Kinetic Construction (Standing Wave), 1919–20] to restore for the show; [Alexander] Calder gave Pontus a model of The Four Elements [1961], which Pontus constructed in the courtyard in front of the museum, and they found Moholy-Nagy’s [Das] Lichtrequisit [Light Prop for an Electric Stage, 1930] in storage at the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard. 
 And then Billy asked some of the artists whom he was beginning to know in New York to be part of the exhibition. Richard Stankiewicz made a sculpture, The Apple [1961]. Jasper Johns lent an earlier work, Thermometer [1959]. And Bob made Black Market especially for the show. 
 I think he said that the art moves in and out of the piece. Visitors were supposed to take small objects from the suitcase attached to the painting, add something of their own and record it on the lists on clipboards attached to the surface of the painting. And as you said, people took objects and didn’t add anything of their own. I saw a telegram Pontus sent to Billy asking him to ask Bob to send more objects to Stockholm for the opening at Moderna Museet because people in Amsterdam had taken all the ones there. I don’t think Black Market fared too much better in Stockholm.",389
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20388,An interview with Julie Martin: No. But I do think Billy never thought that he was an artist. He never did. He said it was always a danger if the accountant or the engineer thought he was the artist. The collaboration wouldn’t work if people didn’t recognize what’s an aesthetic decision and respect it and respect the artist and trust the artist. I think he was quite extraordinary and unique in that way.,89
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20395,"An interview with Julie Martin: But it’s very important. I think there was a lot of collaboration between Bob with his curators—choosing the work. Which works do you choose? Was Bob involved? I don’t know. I agree with you. I think it’s another process that the artist is involved in. There, the curator probably has a little bit more to say because they start out by, “Well, let’s place this, this, and this.”",107
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20392,"An interview with Julie Martin: Somebody’s talking to him. You could ask them to ask that question. One of the collaborations is when you’re setting up a show. How much the artist is involved and Bob— when he was doing that—that was a huge collaboration. Some of the people that worked with him on artworks. Prints—some of the people at Gemini [G.E.L., Los Angeles] or ULAE [Universal Limited Art Editions, West Islip, New York].",108
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20396,"Q: It’s not worrying me. It’s a very interesting thing—where that boundary is of what an aesthetic decision is and how you mark that off. To me—part of what’s new for me is that I associate, as I was saying, this group of artists, or this generation, with a breakdown of my certainty about where art starts. Even the pieces you’ve just mentioned, like Soundings or Solstice, I feel like by bringing the viewer into the process of shaping the environment, part of what they’re saying to the viewer is, “You are a participant in the aesthetic decision-making of inhabiting the piece. You’re deciding when the sliding doors close or you’re deciding, by whether you make noise or don’t make noise, whether you can see something.” That to me is saying, “Come into the aesthetic decision. You can make an aesthetic decision too.” That’s why I’m hesitating at the idea that there’s—",223
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20400,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, it’s a beautiful piece to experience—to see the lights changing and the images of the chairs tumbling through space—but interacting with it over a long period of time is not easy. Some people have played their violin to it or sung to it. Maybe you’re creating that work of art. It’s true. You’re creating a specific experience, anyway. The art is there to give you an experience. You are creating the experience. It’s also Bob’s idea of collaboration. He invites the viewer to collaborate with him on creating the experience of the work. So not only does he collaborate with his materials and with the people working with him, he collaborates with his future viewers. But at the same time he gives them the responsibility for completing the piece. It’s up to the individual how much he or she wants to commit to working with the piece.
 I think you do have a really interesting point, but I think the answer is that the artist has already conditioned the limits of what decisions you, the viewer, can make. You can talk or not talk. If you come into the space and silently stand on your head, then you will see yourself in the mirror, but you won’t activate the lights. Maybe I’m being pedantic, I don’t know. You can walk into it, or you cannot walk into it. You can’t switch the doors around. You can’t have it not work.",320
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20404,"An interview with Julie Martin: But I give you your point. I see your point. I think you’re right. I mean the viewer extends the work. You’re back to Bob’s idea of extending the life of the work. If the work can change anytime someone sees it and it becomes different, then you’re really extending the life of it and making it new and fresh each time somebody else comes. That’s an aesthetic that you want. You want that aesthetic rather than a painting that just sits.",112
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20410,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, of course. That’s going from Duchamp’s idea that the viewer completes the work of art. That it’s not complete until somebody sees it and then the act of seeing it completes it.
 That brings the viewer in. I think you are part of the aesthetic decision but within a really narrow range. The artist has conditioned the experience. It’s not like you can do anything. It’s like you walk into Soundings and of course you can remain silent. And if so, then your experience is to see yourself in the mirror. You see yourself as part of the visual image of the piece. If you talk to it or to another person in the room, then you see the lights illuminating the silkscreened chairs. Then if you sing, you get something different. But nothing moves, like Solstice.
 I also think that an important part of a work is what the artist chooses not to do or not to put in it. For Soundings, Bob decided to use only images of a wooden chair, maybe one that had been in his kitchen for a long time. He took many photographs of it and when the lights come on in Soundings it does look as if the chair is tumbling around, but it’s only one chair. That is an aesthetic decision. He made it in black and white. All these—what I call limitations—lead to a singularity and purity amid the multiplicity of lights going off and on as people talk or sing to it. Of course, it was an aesthetic decision that Bob wanted the triggering devices for the lights to respond differently to different people. But he left it up to the engineers, Fred Waldhauer and Cecil [H.] Coker, to figure out how to split the sound spectrum and choose the placement of the microphones, et cetera.
 I see it being about responsibility and commitment. The artist offers you the opportunity to participate in the experience of the work. He makes the experience available to you. It’s up to you how much of your time, energy, intellect you want to commit to experiencing the work—to discovering it in, if not all, at least many, of its dimensions. And it’s an interesting question about interactive art in the sense that people can’t do it for very long. It’s really interesting how long a viewer will talk or clap their hands or sing to Soundings.",513
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20411,"An interview with Julie Martin: Right. But, of course, a painting is always new every time you see it. Very few paintings you can remember to the point of saying, “Oh I’ve seen everything there is to see.” I mean, if you’re being serious about it. Maybe a monochrome, maybe the White Paintings [1951]. But the shadows change on them; the light in the room changes. They’re always different, you know?
 It reminds me of the first request Bob made to Billy, when they began to work together in the early sixties—how Bob understood how he could use the technology that Billy offered. Billy has written that Bob wanted to create a room that reacted to the person coming into it—the lights, sound, smell, shape, et cetera would react to the individual. A work that changed, responding to each individual. What Bob envisioned was beyond the technology of the day, but over the next years he explored—with his engineering collaborators—the possibilities that the technology could offer him.",223

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20409,"An interview with Julie Martin: Okay. Well then you’re in the social context of art, right? You know, the thing about an aesthetic decision—we’re talking about decisions in the making of the work of art. I think that’s the difference. If the artist wants to make it possible for the individual to keep going and do something that changes the work in some way, that’s his decision to do it. I just mean that when you’re making it, if the engineer would say, “Well, how about a light here? It’s a little dark up there, Bob.” Or, “I have a great-looking chair at home that could fit in this piece.” That’s an aesthetic suggestion that he shouldn’t be making. Do you know what I mean?",180
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20414,"An interview with Julie Martin: Billy Klüver. He always loved to say he was born in Monaco because his father had gone to Spain to be a timber merchant and met his mother, who was on the grand tour. They met in San Sebastian and fell in love and got married. But his father got the flu so they ended up at the nearest good hospital, in Monaco, which in now Princess Grace Hospital, and Billy was born there. But two weeks later they went back to Sweden. His father first owned a hotel, on land between two beautiful lakes in southern Sweden in a town called Ed, for a while. And then his father, who was Norwegian and grew up in Steinkjer, Norway, missed the snow and the skiing and so in the thirties he built a ski hotel at a place called Sälen in Sweden. And so Billy grew up in Ed and then in Sälen and then later, when his parents divorced, in Stockholm. He went to the Kungliga Tekniska högskolan, the technical university in Stockholm and majored in electrical engineering. But he soon exercised his interest in film and, as I said, he went across town to the humanities faculty and joined this student film club, which at that time was very active and one of the more liberal or progressive groups of people in Stockholm. Not as progressive as the Communist party or the Socialist party but still very active. He joined the film club and soon, a few years later, became the head of the film club and was importing movies from the United States. And avant-garde movies—Maya Deren, the Whitney brothers, and some that had already been identified in the forties as being the forefront of independent filmmaking. So he knew that world.",362
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20415,"Q: In terms of that invigorating effect—that impact on the engineer—do you think for Billy it was more a matter of being exposed to the process? Seeing the way the artist works? Where it’s not about the kind of corporate demands of Bell but it’s a different kind of process where it’s still problem-solving but you’re solving a different kind of problem. Or was it about the collaboration, people in different fields working together? And that has an impact on you because you think about what you do as an engineer in a different way. Or was it about the mindset? Was it more about the art that’s emerging from this stuff is changing the way the engineer potentially sees the world? Because it’s interactive art: you’re speaking into it, you’re hearing it, you’re walking through it. Do you see what I mean? Which—or is it all of those?",202
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20412,"Q: I’m Brent Edwards and I’m here on August 14, 2013, to do an oral history for the Rauschenberg Oral History Project with Julie Martin. We’re in this beautiful, vaulted, old—well, half-of-a-chapel space down on Lafayette Street with a found soundtrack of sirens blaring and construction going on the fourth floor of the building. But we still will be able to have a great conversation. So thank you for being willing to do it and talk to me again, Julie.
 I wanted to start by asking you to talk about Billy Klüver and his connection to the art world in the 1960s and how it emerged. How did this engineer get connected to the downtown art scene?",159
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20419,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, Jean started by saying, “I want bicycle wheels.” So that was a mission, for Billy to find bicycle wheels, which he finally found in a shop in New Jersey. Some guy was getting rid of a whole basement full of wheels that they just brought and threw over the wall of the Museum of Modern Art at night. In that case he provided Jean with as many bicycle wheels as he could and Jean could choose how or whether to use them. Jean asked to be taken to the dumps. Jean went with him to the dumps and Jean picked stuff he wanted. I remember him saying he was always surprised at what Jean chose. The piano—I think Jean wanted a piano. Maybe somehow [an] addressograph machine came up as a possibility. But I’m sure Billy would ask Jean, “Is this something you want?” I think he was very sensitive or very aware of what’s the artist’s role and what’s the engineer’s role. And he never thought he was the artist. Never thought he was. I mean, you could suggest something. Or you could [say], “Here’s some batteries.” I think with Bob there was a problem that the only batteries he could get from Bell Labs were bright red and he thought, “Oh, dear.” So Billy brought them to Bob’s. He said, “What do you think?” And Bob said, “Yes, those are great.”
 But he was sensitive to what was an aesthetic question and how the artist worked. As I said, much later when they renovated or restored Oracle, the engineer Per Biorn, who was very active in helping to restore these pieces later on, discovered you could do digital tuning. He could make it so the spectrum went digitally from station to station. But Billy asked Bob, he said, “Per can do this; what do you think? “ And Bob said, “No, I want analog tuning. I want that noise in between stations. I want that sense of noise.” But he did okay other changes. When the French government opened up the FM spectrum to many new stations, he was willing to change the radios from AM—which had been the most populated spectrum in the sixties and seventies—to FM, which made it easier to get the signals into the Centre Pompidou. Then at one point when they were restoring Soundings, Bob was fine with Per’s ideas for updating the mechanisms that triggered the lights off and on. At the same time, Billy asked him, “The mirrors have gotten yellow. They are beginning to oxidize. Do you want new mirrors?” Because when you walk in, all you see is yourself in the mirror. Bob said no. He wanted to keep the original mirrors. He saw this as part of the aging process. So the original mirrors remained. So the point is that Billy always asked the artist when there were choices to be made, even what might seem to be pure engineering choices. I think Billy was really active in drawing the line between an aesthetic— what was the artist’s decision and what was his decision.",672
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20416,"Q: Well, let me ask you one more question about this same topic. And then let’s get to E.A.T. Going back to the Tinguely, even, I’m interested in how Billy sees his role as an engineer. And going back to the Tinguely collaboration, my understanding is that Billy wasn’t just making circuits and arranging explosives and timers but he was, to a certain degree, scavenging in dumps in New Jersey. So where’s the limit for Billy’s—of the engineer’s—role? Where is it distinguished from the artist’s role? Was there a point where Billy would say, I don’t feel like I should be deciding which bicycle is the right one to bring back from the dump? Or was that a question in his mind at that point, do you think?",184
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20417,"Q: So you can make, as an engineer, suggestions about aesthetic matters but the artist, to a certain extent, had veto power to say, “No, we’re not going to clean up the mirror, we’re not going to replace the mirror.”",59
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20422,"An interview with Julie Martin: In a sense, yes, I think so. Not realizing—since they were in the kind of downtown scene—not realizing that this was something that Broadway could actually use or would be interested in. And then Billy worked with John Cage and Merce Cunningham on Variations V [1965], which was to place electric eyes on stage, aimed at lights offstage. When the dancers broke the beam, a sound was triggered in John’s very complex sound system. Billy was thinking a lot about the whole idea of the engineer working with the artist. And his first idea was—two ideas, I think, were coming together. One, he could offer the artist a new palette. This was in some of the early writings. He talked about a new palette that would expand the possibilities for the artist to work with more contemporary materials and be active in society as it was developing. But very early on, from reading C. P. [Charles Percy] Snow, The Two Cultures [1959], Billy very much was looking for a way to invigorate engineering. I think he felt that engineers had to be—at that point, engineering was quite monolithic and the businesses were very monolithic, the telephone company [Bell Labs], Philips, Thomson-Houston. And so the idea of how do you invigorate the engineers was important to him.
 When he began to work with artists, I think he saw that, a-ha, the way the artist works—not the art but the way the artist works—and the kind of attitudes the artist has toward what he or she does excited him. He saw the artist as being a kind of conduit to get the engineer involved in new ideas and new possibilities. And then as he began to work with Bob, he realized the possibilities of collaboration. He said very much that he went from this idea of the engineer offering something to the artist—the idea that the two would collaborate, one-to-one, two professionals. Two people in different fields but collaborating on something where the outcome might be different from what they started with. I mean, it always started from the artist, obviously. The artist had an idea. Bob’s idea to do a sound piece with certain parameters. But the engineer’s contribution from his own profession, and having him think outside what he normally did every day, could invigorate him in his own profession. But the idea was the collaboration. I remember hearing it when I first got involved. This word was very strange to me because at that point, the only collaboration you knew about was like World War II and it was a negative word. You know, collaborating with the Nazis, for example, in France. It was interesting that this must’ve been a really new concept because even the word was something that—as far as I knew, at least—wasn’t in common parlance. So I think the beginning of this whole idea of collaboration started with Bob and Billy and was very much influenced by Bob’s attitude toward the way he worked.
 [INTERRUPTION]",635
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20423,"Q: One other question about this early period and that’s the other side of Billy’s life, which is the engineering side. We talked about this the other day when we were talking but I wanted to get you on tape here talking about it. How did this go down with Bell? So here’s an engineer who is supposedly working. What was their reaction to someone who got very involved in the art world? We were talking about the number of hours the engineers were spending on 9 Evenings. How did that work in terms of their day jobs?",117
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20427,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, I was about to say all of the above, but not the third one. First, I think the process—just being involved in working with an artist and working outside the lab, working in kind of a dirty situation as opposed to, say, the clean, well-organized lab, would have the engineer use his skills differently. But I think Billy felt certain things about the artist, the way the artist works. First, taking full responsibility for the work. In other words, an artist doesn’t make any excuses for what he or she shows. “Oh, I would have done it better if— If my boss had given me more time—” So this idea of responsibility, commitment. You’re committed to a project, you’re committed to a process. These are the kinds of things that the artist had. The sense of scale—human scale. And focus on the individual. Billy thought it was an important thing that the artist was sensitive to. The economy of means that the artist works with. There are no superfluous elements in a work of art. I mean, the painting or the sculpture, it’s what has to be there—what he or she wants to be there. There’s nothing superfluous or decorative, necessarily. So it was, I think, the process and certain aspects of the way the artist works and the artist’s concerns that Billy thought could inspire engineers to think differently, to think more about the individual, think about things that suited the individual more. The art—there’s no sense that you had to understand the art. I mean, you were an engineer and this was an artist and these were two professionals who could come together solving a problem, working on a project.
 I think what’s really interesting, now that I’ve been studying it, is the breakdown of the situation where—the artists were supposed to go to Sweden for the Festival of Art and Technology, which happened in ’66—the breakdown between Billy and Knut Wiggen. Knut Wiggen felt the artist working with the technology would introduce the technology to the public and bring the public or the person looking at the work up to speed about what’s happening in the world that has been changed by the technology. And I think Billy’s idea as an engineer and knowing what the artist was working with—the artists were not working with leading-edge technology. He felt the technology should be almost invisible. What was important was the work of art that came out of it, not that this was some message about technology. Or the fact that it was better because it was embodying new technology. It really was the final work of art, the final image. So I think your last idea is not part of his thinking. The importance of the collaboration didn’t have to do with the art as instruction. It had to do with the process and the commitment to a process and the commitment to building or realizing something.
 Again, that’s why he very much thought about artists and engineers working together without emphasis on scientists. Because he felt science is much more abstract and much more about thinking, whereas the artist and the engineer were both hands-on kind of people—and again, committed to problem-solving. “Let’s get something done. Let’s make something.” So although E.A.T. talked about artists, engineers and scientists, the focus was really on engineering.",729
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20424,"Q: Why don’t we go towards 9 Evenings and the founding of E.A.T.? It’s interesting, as I have been rereading this history—this narrative, this chronology—the degree to which Sweden plays a crucial role in this entire engineering part.",60
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20438,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, first, Bell Labs was a really unique place back then. It was the premier lab for electrical engineering and communications. And it was supported by the fact that AT&T was a monopoly and a regulated monopoly. I mean, protected by the government but also regulated by it. And also, it was vertical. You had AT&T that provided all local and long-distance service. You had Western Electric, which built the equipment. And you had Bell Labs, which developed it. And so there was this kind of flow between all of the divisions of the Bell system. Bell Labs did research for all branches of the Bell system, from developing methods and educating incoming telephone operators to designing and building digital switching systems. And the labs itself was very open. Once you were a researcher, you could choose to a certain extent what you were doing your research on, and you could come and go as you wanted so long as you did some research.
 Bell Labs actually also had an artist-in-residence program. They invited—especially Max [V.] Mathews and John Pierce—musicians to do computer music. Lillian [F.] Schwartz worked with [Kenneth C.] Ken Knowlton at the labs and they collaborated on films, on digital filmmaking. So the researchers who were interested in music and film had their programs and sometimes invited artists to work at the labs. But Billy’s contacts were with New York and very much outside the labs. He brought artists to visit the labs but Bell or AT&T never sponsored what he did. So most of 9 Evenings, which was this—we can talk about that later—was done by the engineers at night, weekends, and vacation time. Toward the end, the week or so before the opening, the engineers took vacation time in order to work on it.
 Many years later, in the nineties, Billy asked John Pierce, “You saw that all this energy was going into this outside project. Why didn’t you stop it?” John Pierce replied that people were so positive about it and there was such a positive energy that if he’d stopped it, it would have had a very negative impact. So he understood the positive value of working on projects with artists. And actually, even earlier when Billy worked with Tinguely in 1960, he told [Rudolf] Rudi Kompfner, who was his boss right above him, but he didn’t tell John Pierce. And of course, it was written up in the New York papers, “the machine that destroys itself.” It was in the Times and in the [New York] Post. And the day after, John Pierce rushed into Billy’s lab. And Billy was like, “Uh-oh, this is it.” And John Pierce said, “There’s only one thing wrong. Why wasn’t I invited?” Then, of course, Pierce went to Stanford [University, California] to the music department—he and Max Mathews—when they retired from Bell Labs. So these two supervisors were very interested in the intersection of engineering and art.",659
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20442,"An interview with Julie Martin: Bob Rauschenberg. There were so many Bobs in those days. But Bob Rauschenberg’s piece, it started with a tennis game on the floor of the armory. Frank Stella and Mimi Kanarek, who was Frank Stella’s tennis pro, played tennis. The rackets had been modified so that the handle was drilled out and a very small FM transmitter was put in the handle of the racket connected to a contact microphone at the head of the handle. Then around the outside of the racket was a wire antenna. So every time the racket was hit, a very loud “bong!” went through the armory and a light went off. Frank and Mimi played until it got completely dark, at which point a crowd of five hundred people that Bob had recruited from the Downtown Community School and maybe another school—he said, by contributing to their scholarship fund, the parents volunteered—and they came out onto the stage in the dark. The space was lit by infrared light and there were infrared sensitive cameras picking up the activity and projecting it to three screens hung above the audience. So you could feel the presence of this large crowd but you couldn’t see it. You could only see them on screen. And then Bob had very simple instructions that he signaled from the balcony.
 I think David White may have talked about this because he was one of the signalers with flashlights. Two flashlights meant something, three flashlights another. So things like: hug the person next you; take out a white handkerchief; sing a song; turn around. There were very simple movements that people could do. Then at the end—the first time Bob did it, that was the end.
 The lights came up and the people bowed. But then he said that he felt it was too harsh somehow. So he added a third section. When the part with the people ended, they just went off the stage in the dark. Oh, one thing. The first night, as they came in, they were asked to say, “My name is—” And so you had this series of names of people—“my name is so-and-so—my name is so-and-so”—that played over the speakers during the section in which they performed. He had also asked the engineers to tape-record the people saying their names and planned to use that tape for the second performance. But somebody lost the tape— No, they recorded over the tape because they were recording every night. So only about eight names were left. So I think he recorded and played the sound of the loud “bong!” the second night. And the second night he also added a third part. When the crowd was finished, they left the space in the dark and a spotlight followed him and Simone Forti whom he had put in a cloth bag that he carried to different parts of the armory floor. He would put her down and then pick her up and carry her to another part of the armory, as she continued to sing a Tuscan love song that echoed throughout the armory. I remember that, actually, this was something they had done kind of for fun at the after party in December, after the performances on Forty-first Street. I remember that Claes and Patty were doing improvised scenes on the stage. The curtain would open and they’d be in a certain position; then it would close and open to another pose. So they were doing sort of an impromptu performance. What Bob did, he put Simone in a bag that was lying around and then carried her through the party while she was singing. He must have remembered that image and then incorporated it into the piece the second night.",778
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20440,"An interview with Julie Martin: I graduated from Radcliffe in ’60 and I came to the Russian Institute at Columbia for a master’s and what they called a certificate degree. But I got more interested in looking at things in New York and doing things in New York so I wasn’t the best student. But a guy I was going out with, Robert Fagan, who was a poet and an independent art historian, knew Bob Whitman from Englewood. Bob Fagan was a little bit older but his brother had known Bob and a kid named Hugh Mitchell. So when Whitman put on a performance called American Moon in December of 1960, we went to it.",138
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20441,"An interview with Julie Martin: I think certainly with Billy over the years there was a kind of dialogue with Pontus. And then also Fylkingen, which was a contemporary music society in Sweden. But the music world adopted the new technology really early. With the advent of the transistor and electronics and the change from vacuum-tube technology, so much of it impacted sound: making it, recording it, playing it, broadcasting it, et cetera. I mean, you had a new music program at the WDR [West German Broadcasting] in Germany with [Karlheinz] Stockhausen and those people inviting Cage in ’57, ’58 to come and work there—the Darmstadt [International] Summer Course for New Music. So in Europe, in particular, you had this interest in technology from the music side.
 To go back to ’65, Billy had worked with a number of these artists. He really wanted to expand his activities but he didn’t quite know how to do it. So he started out by thinking to write a book, “Engineering and Art.” He began by writing to artists he knew, asking, “What ideas do you have using new technology?”—thinking that he could introduce artists’ ideas to the engineering community. Then Knut Wiggen, who was head of the Fylkingen music society in Stockholm— probably through Pontus, or maybe he knew Billy independently—contacted Billy with the idea of an American participation in a festival that he was planning called Festival of Art and Technology: Visions of the Now. Could there be an American contribution to this? He wanted to meet John Pierce and invite him to participate along with Buckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan. His ideas were a little bit abstract or intellectual. But anyway, Billy went to Bob and said, “There’s this opportunity, what do you think?” And Bob was really excited about it. They put together a group of their artist friends. Billy recruited people at Bell Labs, whom either he had worked with or he knew were experts in certain areas that could be applied to performance, and the artists and engineers started meeting to find a way of working that would lead to performances that incorporated the new technology. They began meeting and working together in January of ’66. And, as I said, unfortunately there was this intellectual difference between the Swedish and American groups that became more and more pronounced and magnified. So the relationship got— When these things happen, everything becomes a problem. From how do you publicize the festival? And how many engineers do you bring to Sweden? So it just became very, very difficult.
 By July it became clear that the American group really was not going to go to Sweden, at which point, in true American style, they said, “Okay, let’s put on the show here, folks. Let’s put on the show here, kids.” The typical Hollywood movie. So they decided to hold the performances in New York. And Simone Forti found the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington at Twenty-fifth Street and everybody liked it because that’s where the first Armory show in 1913 was held, which introduced European art to America. Despite the fact that it had a six-second echo. So if you stood too far apart, you couldn’t hear each other clearly. Of course, Cage and Tudor made great use of this reverberation time but it made things a bit more difficult. So they decided to do the performances there.",738
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20446,Q: But it seems like there are a lot of dancers around and then you start having people like Rauschenberg and Frank Stella moving in ways that might not have happened twenty years or thirty years before.,42
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20447,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, Bob asked Frank Stella to play tennis in Open Score with Stella’s tennis teacher. Bob may have considered tennis as dance but Frank played it seriously. But of course, the history is—the Judson started with young dancers and choreographers working in new ways finding new ways to make dance. Yvonne and Steve and people. Well, [Robert E. “Bob”] Dunn, Judith [Dunn]’s husband, Bob.",102
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20444,"Q: So the origin of one part of 9 Evenings. One thing that occurs to me is, do you think that the presence of dancers—so many of the choreographers and performers crucial to what becomes the Judson scene in the early sixties are so close to this group of visual artists, of sculptors, and painters. Do you think that had a serious impact? And Simone—it’s partly that some people are together but partly that you have movement artists working so closely with visual artists. I was trying to think of an equivalent. I think of things like [Igor] Stravinsky’s Ballets Russes.",134
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20445,"An interview with Julie Martin: The Ballets Russes and Ballets Suédois but they were not quite the same. In those cases you had strong impresarios—[Sergei] Diaghilev and Rolf de Maré—commissioning artists and composers and choreographers to make very finished works for a very elite audience. The artists were advanced avant-garde artists and some of the work was shocking to its audience, like [Vaslav] Nijinsky and Rite of Spring in 1913. But the goal was working together for very finished works for a ballet public. They were professional dance companies.",131
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20450,"Q: Coming back to the engineering and art connection, is it your sense—I should have asked you this before—that it’s unprecedented? In the 1920s, you think of something like Ballet Mécanique [1923–24]. A composer like Stravinsky or Satie, they could have been hanging out with engineers, but is your sense that this is the first time that you really had somebody from a place like a Bell Labs, a person like a Billy, coming into an art scene and working directly with artists? Did it ever happen before?",117
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20451,"Q: Let me ask you to tell the E.A.T. story, which we haven’t quite done. Because it precedes 9 Evenings. So why was E.A.T. founded? The Swedish Festival of Art and Technology initiative falls apart. Can you narrate how—",62
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20449,"Q: Another way to narrate it would be to say that it originates in Black Mountain and that kind of cross-media collaboration that is so prevalent in that space in the fifties. And even more specifically, you could argue that it comes out of a Cage-Cunningham aesthetic. I wondered whether either of those—whether you would say that this kind of cross-fertilization originates with the Black Mountain scene or originates specifically with the Merce Cunningham [Dance] Company? And that you have Cage and Cunningham working so closely together and then people like Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, coming through and working with the company. And then some of those people spiral off but keep collaborating.",148
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20454,"An interview with Julie Martin: Well, I think Billy’s idea was that artists don’t experiment. He had a more rigorous definition of experiments. If you’re a research engineer or scientist you make experiments and those experiments—they can fail as well as succeed. And you often learn even more from failure. If you do an experiment where you know the outcome, it’s not very interesting. But he didn’t think that’s what artists do; they don’t experiment. I think that was the main thing, that it’s not experiments. You’re making works of art. You’re making finished works. You’re not—so that was the main objection, I think.",157
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20452,"An interview with Julie Martin: No, I think it comes out of themselves. I mean, obviously, people talk about the first Happening was this thing that they did at Black Mountain where they put together—Merce danced, people stood on ladders and read, and Bob hung his White Paintings and showed films, possibly. They’re not quite sure. Either he hung White Paintings or showed films, or both. But they did other theatrical performances at Black Mountain. Cage played [Erik] Satie. And then Bob worked with the Merce Cunningham company from 1954 on, for ten years, doing sets and costumes and lighting, through the world tour in 1964.
 I think it’s more natural to people that are really interested in the world around them—interested in doing interesting things. Obviously, Cage was really important. I mean, Bob talks about this idea of permission—that Cage, in a sense, gave people permission—but permission to explore things that interested them. And I think people like Steve and Trisha, Lucinda—they were dancers, choreographers. They were making dances. It’s possible that the fact that Robert Dunn was teaching Cagean ideas applied to dance composition, you can read—I’m not an expert on what they actually did—it sparked something in these younger people to make dances based on new ideas, on normal movement—on task, not on virtuosity. But I think it also came out of them and it was sparked possibly by this open situation, or openness to all possibilities. But I’m not an art historian so I don’t like to draw this line. And of course, Cage and Cunningham, although they worked closely, Cage did the music and Cunningham did the dance. And somebody else did the sets. And that, of course, goes back to Diaghilev and Ballets Russes so you can go all the way back to that. Picasso’s sets and costumes for Parade [1917] and all throughout the twenties.
 But I think Cunningham had his own very specific aesthetic for collaboration. He incorporated chance methods into making his dances and asked composers to make music for the dances but the two processes were completely separate and only came together at the rehearsals. The same for the sets and costumes. They were developed independent of the choreography and music. And the Judson Church situation, they were all taking a step into the unknown and it was more fluid and it was more about friends working together, exploring together. They were all younger and they would be in each other’s pieces and they would help each other out.",543
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20456,"An interview with Julie Martin: Again, I’m not an art historian so I can’t—I mean, people who built things like Gabo, the early Gabo. Who knows? He could have done it himself. Calder himself was an engineer. Gabo did it and [inaudible]. It’s also a Bauhaus idea. The Bauhaus people who came over and ended up in Chicago with the New Bauhaus, and then architecture. So some of these ideas of the melding of disciplines came from this Bauhaus influence. But it’s funny. There was a resistance to this melding of mediums. If you talk to Alfred Leslie, I remember he was a painter and then in 1959 he made a film, Pull My Daisy, and then The Last Clean Shirt [1964]. And he remembers that there was a lot of criticism: you can’t be a filmmaker and an artist, you can’t do this. This was like ’59. Early on, there were these—you are separate. You’re a filmmaker or you’re an artist or you’re a dancer. So something shifted and I don’t know if there were engineers. But I think specifically some of Billy’s ideas—it probably was the first time someone thought about the idea of using non-art technology in art. I mean, art has its own technology—paint chemistry, sculpture, mold making, bronze casting, printmaking, the whole thing. There’s a huge amount of technology in art itself. But this idea of technology that comes from outside art and is incorporated into it, I think this probably was a new idea. And certainly people responded to it. I mean, it got responded to quite extraordinarily.",375
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20460,"An interview with Julie Martin: They went, “Well, we can change it later.” But of course, you never change it. So it did start before the 9 Evenings but I think it was very much around the 9 Evenings. The people that pushed it were Billy and Bob. Bob Whitman was very active. And Fred Waldhauer, who was one of the engineers who really got it, so to speak. I mean, he had been very involved with jazz and had worked with some other musical people so he really understood about the collaboration.",115
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20466,"An interview with Julie Martin: He was a musician who was working as a piano accompanist at the Cunningham Studio. He’d been at the classes John Cage gave at the New School [New York] in 1957 and ’58 and Cage asked him to give some classes in dance composition at the Cunningham Studio. Dunn used many of Cage’s ideas and techniques in the composition assignments he would give the dancers in his classes. And a lot of the younger people took this class: Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Deborah Hay, David Gordon, Elaine Summers, and Lucinda, a bit. Dunn told them to bring finished work to class. As they got more and more interested in doing this kind of work, they wanted to show it somewhere. So Steve and Yvonne went to see the Reverend Howard [R.] Moody at the Judson Memorial Church, which was an activist liberal church in Greenwich Village. Tom Wesselmann, Claes Oldenburg, and Jim Dine had had a gallery space in the basement of the church in 1959 and 1960 and had done some performances there before the Reuben Gallery opened. In 1962, they met with [Alvin A.] Al Carmines [Jr.], who had been hired to work with the arts, and they welcomed the dancers, gave them the space to rehearse and then to do performances in the gymnasium and later in the sanctuary. In July 1962, they performed the First Concert of Dance at the church. And I don’t know when Steve got together with Bob but Bob and Steve were living together during this period. And I don’t know how involved Bob was in this Judson thing. Yes and no. But I think he did some lighting or helped with what costumes were used. So he began to know the dancers.",372

Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20464,"An interview with Julie Martin: Yes. Fred was more hands-on technical. He was one of the people designing the digital switching system, the T1 [transmission] system, working on developing that. And later he developed the first digital hearing aid. He had the idea. He said he realized it when he was driving his rattley Toyota, that no matter how loud he made the sound, you couldn’t hear the jazz he was playing. He realized it was about which frequencies need to be amplified. His mother was going deaf as well so he had that experience. He realized that it was the frequencies and if you could tune a hearing aid to raise the frequencies that were missing in the ear that it would be more effective.",150
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20465,"An interview with Julie Martin: Recently, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts—which was initially called the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts and was started by Cage and Jasper Johns in 1963, initially to support a season of Merce’s in New York but then expanded to support performance in general—had their fiftieth anniversary. So they started looking at their archives. I was very interested in it and they came to me because actually, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts was like what would now be called fiscal sponsor; we didn’t have those words in those days. They helped sponsor it and the money went to them so that people who donated to it could take a tax deduction.
 I think very early on, as soon as the artists got started, Billy kind of wanted the American group to be independent and he saw that there wasn’t the kind of support or enthusiasm for what they were doing in Sweden. So very early in May, he started going to people to raise money for the American side. Walter [K.] Gutman, who supported dancers, and Vera [G.] List and people like that, people he knew. He began to raise money and it went to the Foundation for Contemporary Arts and then was spent by them. Looking at the chronology, at the point when the Swedish trip collapsed and the group decided to produce the performances here, it was already being called 9 Evenings: Theatre & Engineering. And at that point, the foundation started an independent bank account for 9 Evenings. That was in about August so I think the idea began to be discussed— “Well, we should have our own organization that can take grants and get tax deductions.” So I think the talking plus the excitement about what they were building and the possibility of other artists being able to use the equipment—it was, at this point, pretty much focused on that situation. So on September 26, I think, it was incorporated. I think they wanted to call it something like Engineering in Art or Art in Engineering. But Frank Konigsberg, who was a lawyer, said when he either went to Albany, or researched it, he found that you’re not allowed to call something engineering if you didn’t do engineering. So he came up with the idea of Experiments in Art and Technology. And when everybody heard it, they thought, “Oh, god.” But it was too late, or they just sort of accepted it.",501
Julie Martin Oral History Transcript,Q20471,"An interview with Julie Martin: Barely funded, as we say. I think one of the things that got it going was a grant from John Hightower at the New York State Council on the Arts. In those days it was really much more informal. I think they made a request and we got I think eight thousand dollars from the New York State Council on the Arts. Somebody else made a request to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and we got some money there. And I think there were some individual and corporate sponsors. In the beginning there was emphasis on working with industry and within industrial laboratories to have industrial sponsorship for artist-engineer projects. We even hired a person to be director of relations with industry, Jean[-Jacques] Erlichman.",152
