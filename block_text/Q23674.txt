USE OF TWO MICROPHONES WITH SEPARATE AGOC'S PRODUCES THREE EFFECTS. IT INCREASES THE INSTABILITY OF MODES; IT MAKES THE SOUND SOMEWHAT MORE MELODIOUS, DUE TO THE COMB-FILTER EFFECT OF TWO MICROPHONES; AND IT GIVES THE PERFORMER ADDITIONAL CONTROL OF THE SOUND. MOVING THE MICROPHONES CLOSE TOGETHER PRODUCES A DOMINANT LOW-FREQUENCY ZERO THAT FORCES RESPONSE TO BE MAINLY HIGH FREQUENCY. MOVING THE MICROPHONES FURTHER APART ALLOWS THE COLORATION TO SHIFT TO LOWER FREQUENCIES. WHEN THE PERFORMER IS CLOSE TO THE LOUDSPEAKER, HIS MOTIONS READILY DOMINATE THE SOUND, BECAUSE FROM SPEAKER TO MICROPHONE IS LARGELY DIRECT PATH. WHEN HE MOVES FURTHER AWAY, HOWEVER, RESPONSE MODES OF THE ROOM BECOME MORE DOMINANT.
