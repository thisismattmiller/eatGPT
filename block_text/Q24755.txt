In 1994 Fujiko Nakaya called and asked for help in getting stones from Greenland for a stone and fog garden in a museum to be built in honor of her father, Uchikiro Nakaya, a famous snow scientist, who had grown the first artificial snow crystal. He had worked on the ice cap in Pituffik in North West Greenland and Fujiko wanted stones from that area. In July we went to Thule Air Base and Danish contract workers, who maintain the base for the U.S. Air Force, gathered stones from fields of stone at the base of the ice cap that  fills the center of the Island. Sixty tons of stones in forty-eight boxes were shipped to Japan by way of the Kiel and Suez Canals.  
 This is the official group portrait of everyone who worked on the project at Thule with the ever present Dundas Mountain in the background. Fujiko, wearing a dark cap stands with her sister Sakiko, a geologist. On the other side of her is Col. Robert Cox the commander of the base who became a great supporter of the project. I am standing on the far left, and Julie Magura, our photographer, is kneeling just in front of Julie Martin.
