 For artists this first serious encounter between art and technology has opened the door to a new freedom of expression--and the possibility of virtually limitless new media in store for the future. For engineers it has provided a series of stimulating and improbable challenges, rewarding both in themselves and in the fresh approaches they suggest. For industry a lasting alliance between art and technology holds special implications as demonstrated by the commercial potential of scientific discoveries made in connection with "Nine Evenings."
 
 "The artist's work, like that of the scientist, is an investigation which may or may not yield meaningful results." says Billy Kluver. "Often we do not know the results of this investigation for many years. A1l of the art projects that I have worked on have at least one thing in common: from an engineer's point of view they are ridiculous. That is their value. Perhaps the greatest gift art can make to research is the unique intuition and insight of the artist. The use of the engineer by the artist will stimulate new ways of looking at technology and of dealing with life."
