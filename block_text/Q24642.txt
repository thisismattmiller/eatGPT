Of all the people I met in my life I consider Öyvind Fahlström the only true genius. I had  met Öyvind in the Student Film Society at University in Stockholm, which was the only  intellectual extracurricular group except for the Communist-led Clarte. Originally a  writer and poet, he was a self-taught painter, unlike his wife Barbro Ostlihn, who had  graduated from the Royal Academy in Stockholm. When he told me during one of my  
 visits to Stockholm in the early 1960s that he and Barbro planned to move to the United  States, I offered my help to find a place for them to stay. They arrived on a cargo ship in  Baltimore and stayed for a while at 600 Park Avenue with the Swedish Consul General,  who happened to be Barbro’s uncle. Bob Rauschenberg was leaving his loft on Front  Street, and I asked him if Öyvind and Barbro could take over the lease, which they did.  For years I used to go by their place by around 2 o’clock in the morning on my way home  from an opening or a party and talk to Öyvind while he was working, often assisted by  Barbro who left her paintings, highly geometric renderings of architectural details of New  York buildings, to help him when one of his shows at the Sidney Janis Gallery was near.
