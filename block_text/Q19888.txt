Martin: I remember we had works by [László] Moholy-Nagy and Karl Zerbe and Alexander Archipenko. No, it was the art itself, much of it abstract and non-objective, very unlike the Socialist Realism that reigned in the Soviet Union. I remember going to visit Archipenko in his studio in New York—he was still alive at the time—and interviewing him so I could talk better about his work in that exhibit. Then we were supposed to talk about the art. There was another section that was about the use of plastics in the home, in the kitchen. So you show the magnificent American kitchen. Then there was Plastics in Industry, [Plastics] in Recreation, [Plastics] in the Office, et cetera. So it was a whole kind of propagandistic thing. Then Plastics in Art was one section.
