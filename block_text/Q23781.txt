People often ask me whether new developments in art take the place of art as it used to be. My view is that far more directions for art are now available than were formerly and that no direction takes the place of another. We are, so to speak, these days richer. We have everything we used to have. The Mona Lisa, for instance, is still with us. On top of which we have the Mona Lisa with a moustache.
