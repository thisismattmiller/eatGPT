Martin: To viewers. I was supposed to talk and answer questions. The idea, I’m sure, was to talk about freedom of expression in the U.S., freedom to make abstract art, et cetera. But the main question they asked was why did I wear my watch on my right arm? Because in the Soviet Union—it was the old system—you were made to be right-handed. So everybody wore their watch on the left arm. So many people noticed. “Why are you wearing your watch on your right arm?” Moscow was a very sophisticated audience. There were debates among the viewers about the art and there were defenders of the abstract art on view. The exhibition traveled to Moscow, Kiev, and Tbilisi. And in Kiev and Tbilisi the reaction of visitors was more conservative. It was like, “Oh, that’s not art.”
 Then that fall I came back to Columbia. But I got more interested in living in New York than going to Columbia so it took me five years to get my master’s [degree] and what they called a certificate from the Russian Institute. Well, it was a two-year program. I have to say that. But Ididn’t finish it until, I guess, fall ’65, when finally they didn’t let you stay at Columbia for fifty dollars a semester. Up until then, as a graduate student, you could just register. If you finished your courses, you could just register and for fifty dollars or something you could stay on. Then all of a sudden, there were charges. You had to pay for at least three points and maybe for a whole semester. I can’t remember. So I finished my thesis very quickly [laughs] and got out.
