Peter Hirsch designed a 70 kHz Doppler sonar system for Lucinda Childsâ€™ piece, Vehicle.  Childs swung three red buckets around inside the ultrasonic sound beams created by  transmitters in the three stands as seen in the photograph. The reflected signals from the  buckets mixed with the original 70 kHz signal, and the resulting beat frequency fell in the  audible range. The sound was transmitted to the speakers around the Armory. It was a  swishing noise like wind blowing through a forest.
