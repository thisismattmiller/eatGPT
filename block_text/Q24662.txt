Öyvind Fahlström’s Kisses Sweeter than Wine was a complex, poetic theater  performance, a three-dimnsional collage of images and sound incorporating live actors,  elaborate props, and a tryptich of slide, movie and television projections. Engineers  developed for Fahlström a pillow that “could sing out while it was bounced on the floor,”  a remote-controlled mylar missile circling the Armory, and snowflakes that fell upward.  Characters included idiot savants who could memorize enormous amounts of data or  make multi-digit calculations in their heads; a girl in a plastic swimming pool of Jello;  Chinese Sparrows under attack; and Space Girl, who descended in the winch hoist  carriage from the ceiling and was greeted by performers in white dress shirts who  gathered around her as she held up the head of President Lyndon B. Johnson.
