Q: I teach a lot of jazz and literature. I teach in the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia. There are people like Cecil Taylor and the artists of this same generation. There’s a famous journalist’s description of Cecil Taylor’s piano playing that describes it as eighty-eight tuned drums. There are people who talk about Max Roach, the drummer, as the most melodic drummer.
