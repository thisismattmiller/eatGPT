Martin: There was a press conference for the 9 Evenings held in the chapel at Bob [Rauschenberg]’s place [Lafayette Street studio, New York]. It was for the artists and engineers working on the 9 Evenings to talk with the press sometime in September in 1966. I was not really part of the artists and engineers group. I was working with Whitman. But then afterwards, I helped Simone write her piece for Artforum. That came out in February of ’67. [Note: Simone Forti, then Simone Whitman, “Theater and Engineering: An Experiment, 1. Notes by a Participant.”]
