Martin: Homage to New York. Right. And after that experience Billy wanted to keep working with artists very much. So he would say to artists whom he was getting to know, “Do you have an idea that needs an engineer?” Jasper [Johns], for example, came up with the idea of using a neon letter in a painting and not having the painting attached to the wall by wires. He asked for portable neon. In the different collaborations that Billy had before E.A.T.—and it was also true with E.A.T.—the impetus came from the artist. It didn’t mean the work didn’t change once the artist and engineer were working together, but the impetus—the basic idea—came from the artist. For example, Andy Warhol asked for a floating light bulb. When battery technology made it that the bulb would have to be as big as a house to float, Andy looked at the heat-sealable material Billy had found for him and asked for clouds. While Billy and his colleagues at Bell Laboratories were trying to figure out how to heat-seal rounded shapes and not have them fall over, Andy simply folded the material over and made his rectangular Silver Clouds [1966].
