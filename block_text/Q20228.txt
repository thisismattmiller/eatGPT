Martin: I think so. Like administrative assistant. On projects, project assistant, I would think. Whatever was needed. It’s hard to say. Then, of course, after 1974, E.A.T. became less and less active. The problem was in terms of funding. If you look at a lot of the proposals we made in the early seventies, we were trying to straddle the professions. We didn’t have long experience in education or in technology development for underdeveloped countries. You just didn’t have the—what do you call it—roots. We didn’t have the reputation or roots in the structures of other institutions in the society. You weren’t part of the establishments. Some people caught on and worked with us, on Children and Communication or City Agriculture, for example. But to try to bridge that gap in terms of funding or getting people in different institutional structures to try new approaches—to let the artist in, so to speak—it didn’t seem to work. We have a lot of proposals that we made then that look great now but it was too soon. I think it was just too soon. But it would probably be too soon now, even.
