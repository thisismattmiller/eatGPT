I am after a work around the stability of a film image and the immediacy of news­ flash. The images are con­cerns - the whole piece makes an image. Television is a great way to collect stuff; besides what's on the air, a camera on anything brings it in live- a local newsflash. Film is a rock solid steady unchangeable record of someone looking at some­ thing past.
