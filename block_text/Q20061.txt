Martin: Right. That may have been the first wireless FM transmitter. Then the engineers developed a wireless FM transmitting system for 9 Evenings. They designed and built wireless amplifiers, transmitters, coders and decoders, et cetera—a whole stage system that ran on batteries. They called it the TEEM system. But nobody thought about patenting or commercially developing it. Then wireless technology for the stage developed in the trade. So now what? You can have stage production with fifteen or twenty different wireless mics on stage. The engineers working on 9 Evenings developed the equipment out of this need of the artists to do those certain pieces. But it wasn’t seen, necessarily, as something you would go ahead and pursue because that wasn’t what they were working on day to day. The engineers designed special equipment for the 9 Evenings but it was very much their response to the needs of the artists in performance. For example, Fred Waldhauer’s Proportional Control System that allowed him to move sound from speaker to speaker for David Tudor’s piece.
