Q: I’m Brent Edwards and I’m here on August 14, 2013, to do an oral history for the Rauschenberg Oral History Project with Julie Martin. We’re in this beautiful, vaulted, old—well, half-of-a-chapel space down on Lafayette Street with a found soundtrack of sirens blaring and construction going on the fourth floor of the building. But we still will be able to have a great conversation. So thank you for being willing to do it and talk to me again, Julie.
 I wanted to start by asking you to talk about Billy Klüver and his connection to the art world in the 1960s and how it emerged. How did this engineer get connected to the downtown art scene?
