Martin: Barely funded, as we say. I think one of the things that got it going was a grant from John Hightower at the New York State Council on the Arts. In those days it was really much more informal. I think they made a request and we got I think eight thousand dollars from the New York State Council on the Arts. Somebody else made a request to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and we got some money there. And I think there were some individual and corporate sponsors. In the beginning there was emphasis on working with industry and within industrial laboratories to have industrial sponsorship for artist-engineer projects. We even hired a person to be director of relations with industry, Jean[-Jacques] Erlichman.
