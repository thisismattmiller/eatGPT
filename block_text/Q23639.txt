'No Place Is Safe' "If you don't accept technology you better go to another place because no place here is safe." Asked what made technology so exciting for him, he replied: "Nobody knows the kind of art that will be created if two or three men in diverse fields become collaborators." About 370 artists already have written to Dr. Kl√ºver and Mr. Rauschenberg seeking technical assistance for projects they have in mind. The letters include requests for information on synthetic fabrics, pigments, enamel finishes, translucent spheres, micro-organisms, electromagnetics, "slow chemical destruction of objects," "extending the range of sensory perception" and an "efficient way" to make paintings appear and disappear. Mr. Rauschenberg himself has project in mind with a problems that he has not yet been able to solve technically. He envisages a room "that would be responsive to weather, to people viewing it, to traffic, noise and light." This he sees as the art of the future. "Nobody wants to paint rotten oranges anymore," he said.
