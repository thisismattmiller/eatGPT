Martin: They weren’t part—there was very little social mingling. Billy was one of the very few people who continued to go to art events. Maybe Fred a little bit. Fred was more into jazz. Jazz was his thing. But for most of the engineers working with artists, art never became part of their world. I think that’s important.
