Martin: I mean, fine. Fine. You know? Fine.
 Another thing that Billy said that I think is not as popular now. People are talking now so much about art and science—maybe you’ve read—where he felt it was art and engineering. He says that engineers are the people that solve problems. They’re physical. They’re in the world. This is what the artist needs. You were still working with physical things. I always think of the title of Steve Paxton’s piece for 9 Evenings as being emblematic of the work of this period. Physical Things [1966]. The scientist and artist, what are they going to talk about? They’re going to talk about ideas. Fine, but that’s not the collaboration that interested him necessarily. Maybe people now are talking about art and science because things have gotten to the level of trying to—the ideal level. Some of these scientific ideas have been around long enough that they’ve begun to come back into art.
 But at that point, Billy even said toward the end of his life that for him, it was not about art and science. It was about art and engineering and this hands-on relationship to solving problems, finding ways to design or build things.
