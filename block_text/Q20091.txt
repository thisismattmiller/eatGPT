Martin: I’m trying to think. Billy’s contribution to Tinguely’s piece was the timing pieces. Billy said Jean had said that it really changed his work. He started doing bigger pieces and not necessarily technical pieces. That was a contribution—that it could be done automatically, not just mechanically. But that you could have events triggered over time was probably Billy’s contribution to the collaboration. Although he was active in getting the requested bicycle wheels—taking Tinguely to the Newark [New Jersey] dump and buying other equipment and chemicals that Jean requested.
