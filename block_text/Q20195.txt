Martin: Well, the names are there. The cards with the names of the engineers on them and on the back are names of artists who were given the engineer’s name. It’s a primitive record of who was matched with whom, so maybe one could follow up with the engineers and the artists. The cards are all at the Getty Research Institute [Los Angeles].
 In the early seventies we were updating the matching system. First we designed and printed a more complete and detailed edge-notched card for the McBee System that would have allowed us to keep better track of the matches. We also started to develop a computer database of artists and engineers so they could get in touch with each other that we called EATEX.
