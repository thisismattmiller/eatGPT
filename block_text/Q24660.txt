For Deborah Hay’s dance, Solo, Larry Heilos designed the electrical systems for eight  radio-controlled carts that moved around the Armory floor, which were then covered with  wooden boxes to make platforms for dancers to stand or lie on.  
 Eight formally dressed performers entered and sat like a musical ensemble in front of  antennas that transmitted the FM signal to the platforms They operated the radio-control  system to move the platforms into and around the space. Composer Jim Tenney acted as  ‘conductor’ of the ‘orchestra’.  
 Sixteen dancers, wearing bright white costumes, entered the brightly lit space either  walking or riding on a cart. They then walked in solo, duet or trio formations or rode on  the moving platforms, following specific rules and choreography for dancer and platform  movement in relation to the performance area and to each other. David Tudor performed  Toshi Ichiyanagi’s work Funakakushi. From time to time the lights were turned out,  coming back on to find dancers and platforms in different positions as they had continued  performing in the darkness.
