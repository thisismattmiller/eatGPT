Martin: He had been at Bell Labs and then he came to E.A.T. He was a technical assistant at Bell Labs and then he came to E.A.T. as being in charge of the technical equipment. Iâ€™m not sure of his title. The titles we gave people, who knows? But he had worked closely with Fred Waldhauer and was familiar with the technical equipment at 9 Evenings and at E.A.T. he would help the artist with technical problems.
