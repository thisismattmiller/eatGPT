 MAX-FEED [Max Fee] THE PIECE COULD ACTUALLY BE DESIGNED IN MANY WAYS. THE REQUIREMENTS I SET FOR MYSELF WERE TO MAKE SOME- THING THAT WOULD CREATE THE TYPE OF FEEDBACK SOUNDS WHICH I HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN AND PERFORMING WITH. SOMETHING THAT WOULD CREATE THESE SOUNDS IN A LIVE, UN- STABLE, MALLEABLE, BUT NOT CONTROLLABLE FORM. AND THAT WOULD BE CHEAP ENOUGH FOR PRACTICALLY ANYONE TO AFFORD, BUT STILL NOT SACRIFICE FREQUENCY RESPONSE. TO GIVE THESE SOUNDS TO PEOPLE IN A FORM THAT HAS THE CON- STANT AVAILABILITY AND LISTENING PRIVACY OF A RECORDING, AND YET IS NOT A PAST EVENT PRESERVED BUT SOMETHING WHICH IS CONTINUING AND IN THE PRESENT. THE CIRCUIT UTILIZES THE INHERENT IDIOSYNCRACIES AND INSTABILITY OF THE PARTS AND CIRCUITRY OF A TWO TRANSISTOR RADIO FROM JAPAN. BY ADDING A MICROPHONE AND A STAGE OF AMPLIFICATION COUPLED TO A CIRCUIT OSCILLA TING AT RADIO FREQUENCIES, AN EXTREMELY CONTAGIOUS FEEDBACK LOOP IS SET UP WHICH WILL ENCOMPASS ANY NEARBY RADIO RECEIVER. THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT ADVANTAGES TO MAKING THE CLOSING LINK OF THE FEEDBACK LOOP RADIO TRANSMISSION. ONE, THAT THE PROCESS AND INTERFERENCE INVOLVED IN TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING FURTHER MOLDS AND SHAPES THE SOUNDS. AND TWO, THAT IT PROVIDES A UNIVERSAL AND ALMOST FOOLPROOF ACCESS TO ITS OWNER'S HI FI SYSTEM, MAKING THE HI FI SYSTEM PART OF THE FEEDBACK LOOP AND EXPANDING THE FREQUENCY POSSIBILITIES OF THE PIECE TO THOSE OF THE HI FI SYSTEM WITH WHICH IT IS BEING USED.
