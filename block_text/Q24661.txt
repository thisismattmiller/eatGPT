In Robert Whitmanâ€™s Two Holes of Water - 3 seven cars, carrying film and television  projectors, drove onto the Armory floor and parked facing the back wall which was  covered with white paper. On the balcony, television cameras shot performers Trisha  Brown and Mimi Stark moving slowly in front of a curved mirror and Jackie Leavitt  typing; on the Armory floor, another camera shot Susanne di Maria pouring water and  Les Levine using a small fiber optic video camera inside a coat pocket. Whitman fed the  images of these live performances and off-air television images to the television  projectors in the cars. He also cued the drivers to turn on nature films and films he had  made, including a film that superimposed the back and front of a girl as she performed  simple movements. Ken Dewey high up in the winch hoist projected films onto a white  screen on the floor. Contact microphones on the tailpipe of a car and on the typewriter,  and a Bertrand Russell speech were some of the sounds resounding through the Armory.
