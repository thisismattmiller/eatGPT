Martin: We were never really that [well-]funded. I remember that the Rockefeller Brothers Fund turned E.A.T. down for a second grant because we served all artists who came to us. They thought we should be more selective. Another fundraising thing we tried to do was industrial memberships, so we got some money from that.
