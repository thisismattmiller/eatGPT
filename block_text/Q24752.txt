When Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers won the architectural competition to build Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, they included in their winning design an outdoor projection screen on the building facing the large piazza in front to the building. E.A.T. received a contract to develop such a screen. With the help of subcontractor Ford Aerospace, we worked out a proposal for a system using a large projection screen made up of thousands of corner reflectors and an Eidophor projector. John Krauskopf, a researcher in perception at Bell Laboratories, worked with us on the specifications for the allowable  space between the corner reflectors making up the screen. The biggest problem was to overcome the effect of the sunlight which would directly hit the screen. All these problems were solved, but the projection system was judged to be too expensive and was never built.
