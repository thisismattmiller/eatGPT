Martin: Yes, but Bob didn’t ask his bookkeeper to be in the pieces. He didn’t necessarily ask Susan Hartnett, who was his secretary. No, I’m not being facetious. I’m trying to work with you on this. I think the people that were in his pieces were friends who also happened to be artists. He asked Carolyn Brown to be in Pelican and then he put her en pointe. He obviously had an image that he wanted to produce. He wanted this counterintuitive ballerina that you put in this very awkward non-ballerina situation. He was working within dance. I also think there was some sense of working with people who were performers and whose work you liked—whose performance style, or lack of style, you liked. There was a shared—I hate to say aesthetic but more a shared approach to what they were doing. They appeared in each other’s works and appreciated each other’s works. Bob R. very much worked with close friends in those years. Steve, Alex, and Deborah were in all of his pieces in 1963, ’64 and ’65. In fact, the four of them formed what they called Bastard Theater and tried to get performance engagements as a group. And the four worked together on performances they gave as side activities during Merce’s world tour in 1964. Both Trisha and Simone were in Linoleum, playing the same part in different productions of the work. Trisha was in Spring Training.
 He didn’t try to do engineering. He didn’t go to the labs and try to tell the engineers what to do— do you know what I mean?
