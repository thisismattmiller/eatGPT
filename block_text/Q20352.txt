Martin: Exactly. Then he started working with the clay. When he did the cardboards in clay with [Donald] Don Saff, he was working with the technology within art. [Note: Tampa Clay Pieces, 1972–73] And then ROCI, the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange, which he started in 1984 and pursued for more than six years [1984–91]—the idea of traveling the world, finding materials that mattered to the people in the countries he visited, and then bringing it back to them as art and showing not only art made in and from their culture, but art made from other cultures. His way of spreading knowledge, understanding, friendship, and peace. Many of the countries he chose to go to were not easy and his choices had deep political meaning: Chile, Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, East Berlin, Tibet, Venezuela. He never made “political art” but the act of going to the country, meeting and interacting with artists there, and then making art that expressed or reacted to their culture spread understanding and contact among peoples. He kept his idealism and maybe you could say he found new outlets for it or new forms of it. I don’t think the idealism ever went away. He was always trying to find ways of doing it. I was recently looking at the chronology of his life and work and, year after year, the number of posters or print editions he made for a great variety of causes throughout his life is staggering. Then there was his work with Ted Kheel and the UN [United Nations] international conferences both on the environment and on population growth that he not only made posters for, but also attended.
