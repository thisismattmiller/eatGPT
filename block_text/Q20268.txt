Q: The engineer’s never going to become an artist and the artist is never going to become an engineer. You know what you do. I know what I do. You go do your part and I’ll do my part and we’ll put them together. It’s interesting that you never get to the point where this is really an interweaving of the fields. Where suddenly the engineer is a painter, or the engineer is a dancer for a minute.
