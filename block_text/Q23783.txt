Now we have another way of making art that is less individual and more social. It is an activity that is possible only because a number of people come together and join, so to speak, forces. This festival of theater and engineering is an example. Buckminster Fuller speaks of synergy, an energy that results from several energies being combined and which is greater than their sum. Art instead of being an object made by one person becomes a process set in motion by a group of people, in this case artists and engineers. It is not someone saying something, but people doing things that give everyone (including those involved) the opportunity to have experiences they would not otherwise have had.
