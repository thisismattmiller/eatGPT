While working with Alice Denney on the Popular Image show in Washington, it became  clear to me that Pontus should organize an American Pop Art show. I worked with him to  assemble the show, and Ileana Sonnabend in Paris was particularly helpful in getting  works that were already in Europe. We also showed programs of American independent  films. Roy Lichtenstein made the poster for the show, and the exceptional catalogue was  printed on colored paper with a different color for each artist: Dine, Wesselman,  Lichtenstein, Oldenburg, Segal, Rosenquist, Warhol and Wesselman. The exhibition,  which opened on February 29, 1964, raised a lot of consternation in Swedish academic  art circles. I remember vigorously arguing in front of the television camera in favor of  Oldenburg pies. The only paper that touched the subject was VI, the mouthpiece for  Swedish cooperative movement, which printed my article, Pastry as Art. Here Iâ€™m  standing at the show longtime educator Carlo Derkert.
