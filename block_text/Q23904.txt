NINE EVENINGS: THEATER AND ENGINEERING 
Remarks by Deborah Hay 
September 29, 1966
September 29, 1966 "Solo" is a white, even, clear event in space. The performers are part of the space and 1ight. They continue the quality of the area--a white environment. All movement is with the intention of maintaining a balance of order and evenness.
"Solo" is cumulative, gradually accumulating more light, more platforms, more performers, more activity--yet remaining as still and composed as in the beginning.
There are 24 performers. Eight of the performers remain stationery. Formally dressed, they are seated as a musical1 ensemble. From this position they operate eight remote control platforms, which move in and around the space. Sixteen of the performers also move in and around the space, sometimes on the platforms.
Bright lights around the stage area are strongly reflected by the white costumes of the 16 moving performers. The extreme intensity of light bouncing off the costumes modifies the lines of the human body. At times there are no lights. I am interested in creating a middle ground between seeing and not seeing.
The principal visual elements of the piece are moving performers, lights, darkness, remote control platforms, and movement. It is my main intention to make all these elements equal in energy and visibility. I will also use a tape of electronic music by Toshi Ichiyanagi.
