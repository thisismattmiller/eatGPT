Vikram Sarabhai, head of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission, asked E.A.T. to  develop methods for creating instructional programming for television to be used for the ATS-F Satellite which was going to be placed over India. We assembled a group of specialists in engineering, education and television, as well as an artist, Robert Whitman. The group went to India in December 1969 and worked at the Anand Dairy Cooperative in Gujurat State to produce programs for the women who raise buffalo for milk production. We proposed using 1/2” video equipment to gather material from the villages which would be used as visual research notes when the final instructional programs would be made for broadcast over the satellite. Our proposal, with its emphasis on local  input was adopted and became the basis for the programming in what is now known as the SITE television satellite project. I consider this project to be E.A.T.’s most significant contribution.
