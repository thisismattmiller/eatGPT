Martin: Well, I think Billy’s idea was that artists don’t experiment. He had a more rigorous definition of experiments. If you’re a research engineer or scientist you make experiments and those experiments—they can fail as well as succeed. And you often learn even more from failure. If you do an experiment where you know the outcome, it’s not very interesting. But he didn’t think that’s what artists do; they don’t experiment. I think that was the main thing, that it’s not experiments. You’re making works of art. You’re making finished works. You’re not—so that was the main objection, I think.
