In January 1967 we began to publish a newsletter that reported on our efforts to structure  E.A.T. and on the activities we were organizing to bring artists and engineers together. A year later, we split it into two publications: E.A.T. Operations and Information providing  practical news about resources and procedures for member engineers and artists, and TECHNE, a newspaper with articles on collaborations and projects between artists and  engineers using the new technology.
