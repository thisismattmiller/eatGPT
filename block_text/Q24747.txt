With support from Porter MacCray of the JDR III Fund, E.A.T. organized a project for open-ended cultural exchange, called American Artists in India. In 1970 and 1971 we sent sent nine artists to India for one month each to travel, study, teach or work on their own or on collaborative projects with Indian artists, as they chose. The artists documented their stay through drawings, photographs sound recordings or film. Artists who participated in the project were choreographers Trisha Brown, Steve Paxton, and Yvonne Rainer; composers Lowell Cross, Terry Riley, and LaMonte Young; and visual  artists Jared Bark, Jeffrey Lew, Kate Rediker, and Marion Zazeela. In this photograph,  Bark, with his hand on his head, talks with students at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, with whom he worked.
