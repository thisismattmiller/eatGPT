 NINE EVENINGS: THE ATER AND ENGINEERING 
 Technology For Art's Sake
 
 Dancers floating through space; sound transformed into white noise; a performance in total darkness yet seen by the audience; a dancer's movements accompanied by his own internal body sounds; performers and objects directed by unseen forces. The artist's new freedom of expression will take such forms as these in ten unprecedented works which will premiere during "Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineer ing."
 
 "Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineering," a dynamic fusion of music, painting, dance, film, television, and advanced technology, will be presented in New York City from October 13 to 23 at the 69th Regiment Armory, 25th Street and Lexington Avenue. Two or three works will be performed each evening, and each work will be scheduled twice in the series.
 
 The result of extraordinary cooperation between artists and scientists, the works include theater pieces by Oyvind Fahlstrom, Steve Paxton, Robert Rauschenberg, and Robert Whitman; concert pieces by John Cage and David Tudor; and dances by Lucinda Childs, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, and Yvonne Rainer.
