Martin: Well, that was his job, in the sense that Bob did know visually what he wanted to do and he probably had the idea for a long time. That was his part of it. But he didn’t interfere or have anything to do with the building of the frame or the moving mechanism of Solstice until it was ready. And then he did his part and I’m sure he knew that he wanted to do some of those color separations of one image on each panel so when the doors opened and closed, you got a four- color image appearing and disappearing, et cetera, et cetera. Of course, to the engineers, that’s amazing to be able to do the silkscreening that fast.
