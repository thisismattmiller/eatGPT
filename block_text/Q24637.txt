Pontus Hulten, director of Moderna Museet in Stockholm, asked me to be the American  Representative for the Art in Motion exhibition at the museum, an expanded version of  an exhibition he had made at the Denise Rene gallery in Paris in 1955. In the early 60s  Pontus worked closely with Willem Sandberg at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam,  and Art in Motion opened first at the Stedelijk. An expanded version with more than 200  works by 80 artists opened in Stockholm on May 17, 1961. Outside the museum was  Alexander Calder’s sculpture Four Seasons, which Pontus had built from the 1939 model  that Calder gave him during our visit to Roxbury in the fall of 1959. For the the American  contribution to the exhibition I asked a number of artists to make works for the  exhibition. We also included designs by Charles Eames and the drawings of Rube  Goldberg, and I arranged shipment of classic works of Marcel Duchamp, Naum Gabo  and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, whose sculpture, Lichtrequisite, Pontus and I found in a  packing case at the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard.  
 Here in a room with many works by Jean Tinguely, Niki de Saint Phalle sits on the floor  looking at Tinguely’s sculpture, Poor Man’s Ballet. The hanging objects are periodically  activated by the motors that can be seen on the platform near the ceiling at the top of the  photograph.
