 This is to confirm that E.A.T. has lent 1 tennis racquet with FM transmitter in the handle to the exhibition , Rauschenberg / Performance , in the Arthur Houghton Gallery , The Cooper Union from December 7 , to December 22 , 1983 .
 Please let us know when you are taking down the exhibition , and we will be glad to pick up the tennis racquet at a time convenient with your schedule .
  The opening was wonderful , and Bob outdid himself , as always . I can't wait to read the book .
