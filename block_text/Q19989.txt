Martin: I saw Rauschenberg’s show [Robert Rauschenberg] at the Jewish Museum [New York] in the spring of 1963. I remember seeing that. And seeing the large painting, Barge [1962–63]. Incredible. It was along the wall in a room that was wood-paneled. It’s not the same anymore but you know, there was a white room and then you went into sort of the space next door. Then the Barge was just incredible. I remember seeing that so I knew who Bob was. But, I certainly didn’t know about the performances he was beginning to do, Pelican, the stuff in Sweden, Elgin Tie, or anything like that.
