Martin: I’m really not good at this. I think the thing about Bob is incredible directness, straightforward. I mean, he would make a comment about something and he’d be right on. And he didn’t let you get away with any bullshit. He would—his comments or reactions to things that could just turn it just a little bit so you saw another side of it or you saw it clearer or you saw a way to do something clearer. He had very little patience for obstacles or people trying to put obstacles in your way. He was funny, amazing humor, amazing storyteller when he got going. But when he focused, the focus was absolutely right on. Working with him was extraordinarily easy and quite fulfilling.
