PHOTOGRAPHS AVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 14, 1966 TECHNOLOGY FOR ART'S SAKE Electric circuits played "steal the base" while 100-watt light bulbs flashed on and off and speakers gurgled and boomed around the room. A tiny flash- light bulb moved over an electronic board, and across the room another battery of light bulbs obediently blazed. An engineer and a dancer engaged in a spirited tennis volley, delighted with the rhythmic bongs as the ball hit an electronically wired racquet. The first technical rehearsal was under way for "Nine Evenings : Theater and Engineering." "Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineering" is a series of unique performances which will1 be presented in New York City from October 13 to 23 at the 69th Regiment Armory, 25th Street and Lexington Avenue. They are the result of extraordinary cooperation between artists and scientists. Billy Kluver of the Physical Optics and Electronics Research Department of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., supervised and coordinated the work of the many engineers from Bell Laboratories who have devoted their evenings and weekends to the project since last January. Participating artists are John Cage, Lucinda Childs, Oyvind Fahlstrom, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, David Tudor, and Robert Whitman. For two long days last weekend artists and engineers alternately conferred and tested the first electronic environmental system ever developed for theater use. Called THEME (Theater Environmental Modular Electronic), the system is the most ambitious of the technical1 projects undertaken in connection with the "Nine Evenings."
