At night Frosty Myersâ€™ Light Frame sculpture created a tilted rectangle of light around the Pavilion cutting through the Cloud on the dome. Four triangular poles of different heights, were set in a square 130 feet apart at each corner of the Pavilion plaza. At the top of each pole were two 500-watt, high intensity xenon lights, each light directed toward  the light of the neighboring tower, creating a narrow beam of light between each tower to form the rectangle of light.  
 The number of technical breakthroughs in the Pavilion was quite astonishing: the cloud system, the 90-foot diameter spherical mirror, the xenon light frame, the sound loops in  the floor, and the design of the control console. Almost everything we did was new and untried. But even more significant was that the Pavilion was a living, responsive environment: The Cloud and the Floats on the exterior were always moving, and inside the sound, lights and images in the mirror were always changing as people entered and explored it. The artists and engineers had created a large and complex work of art.
