We took this photograph on March 15, the opening day of Expo ‘70, as everyone climbed onto the entrance tunnel for a group portrait.

Sitting: Maja Klüver, Olga Klüver, Tom Mee, Elsa Garmire, Sig Stenlund.  
 About three million people visited the Pavilion during the course of Expo ‘70. Ardison Phillips calculated that the average visitor spent 23 minutes in the Pavilion, longer than any other pavilion. As a matter of fact, we once saw a Japanese family sitting on the astroturf peacefully having their lunch.
