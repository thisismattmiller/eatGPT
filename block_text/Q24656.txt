David Tudorâ€™s Bandoneon ! combined sound and visual elements. In this performance  photograph Tudor is seated to the left on the performance platform, specially constructed  for the Armory space to hold all the electronic equipment and then move it easily onto the  floor of the Armory at the time of the performance. Behind him are Bob Kieronski, who  is operating a Vocoder, which he designed and built; David Behrman; Lowell Cross, who  designed and operated the system for manipulating the images on the video projector; and  Fred Waldhauer, who operated his proportional control system for the performance. Two  of the wooden structures, to which Tudor attached transducers, and the horn speaker  moved around the Armory floor on radio-controlled carts. To the top left can be seen the  television projectors and screens. One of the characteristics of the Armory was a 5- second echo, which was a problem for some of the artists. Tudor worked with this long  reverberation time, and in effect used the entire Armory as his instrument.
