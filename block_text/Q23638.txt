A Natural Marriage He has advised sculptors on how to build self-exploding contraptions, helped painters add neon lights and motors to their works, and provided them with amplifiers, oscillators, synthesizers, image producers and various kinds of electronic detectors to extend their range. To Dr. Kl√ºver, it is a natural marriage. Technology supplies new techniques the materials, new and new imagery to artist. In return, technology gets from the artist new outlooks that make it "more human, more varied, more lifelike, if you wish." Robert Rauschenberg, the 41-year-old soft-spoken ex-Texan who has been called an artistic enfant terrible, agrees that technology has bountiful gifts to offer the artist. Far from fearing it, he finds it an "exciting challenge."
