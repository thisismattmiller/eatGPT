David Tudor proposed a collaborative concert, “Island Eye Island Ear,” to use sound and visual elements to reveal the nature on an island. Parabolic antennas would create sound beams of natural sounds recorded earlier by Tudor on the island for people to walk through. In 1973 we traveled to Knavelskär in the Swedish Archipelago and made this map of the plans for Tudor’s antennas (blue arrows), Fujiko Nakaya’s fog sculpture areas, Jacqueline Matisse Monnier’s kites, and Margaretha Asberg’s dancers.
