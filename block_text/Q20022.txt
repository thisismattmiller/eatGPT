Martin: No, I wasn’t part of that at all. I was working weekends for Whitman. I wasn’t part of any of that. I know the history now because I’ve started studying it. But I didn’t know it at all at the time. I may have gone to the technical rehearsal, which was in the gymnasium of the Berkeley School in Berkeley Heights [New Jersey] where Billy was living and just down the road from Bell Labs in Murray Hill [New Jersey]. I’m not sure I was there. I’ve seen so many photos of the day that I feel as if I was there. But maybe not.
