In the early 1960’s dancers became interested in relating body movements or functions to  sound as they danced. My assistantat Bell Labs, Harold Hodges and I made a small  transmitter for Yvonne Rainer which which she wore attached to her belt. A contact  microphone on her throat picked up the sound of her breathing as she danced. The  transmitter relayed the sound to a speaker. In this photograph Rainer is performing At My  Body’s House in 1964.
