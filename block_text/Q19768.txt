A work built around three elements divided into parts equal in time.
Three elements:
1. Internal sound poten足tials of the body
2. External body color
3. A singular work activity
The body sounds, example:
brain waves, muscle move足ment, eye movement, will be picked up by differential am足plifiers and transmitted to the central control stations to be distributed by the sound person.
All properties and dress will have the color identity of the skin of the performers.
The work activity is the random placement of 100 numbered six foot squares of duck in a ten by ten modular pattern and then retrieved in a correct arithmetic progres足sion and placed centrally. The placement  and retrieving of the squares will be a designation of the two parts.
