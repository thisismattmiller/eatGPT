Q: Even before the event, there was not just [thinking] in terms of funding the event but thinking longer term. A lot of the talking at that point was about the equipment: “We built all this equipment for these artists and it should be shared.” This idea of working with engineers—this was such a great idea, it also should be shared. That we want to create a network because that’s the other purpose that seemed obvious to me. How are engineers going to get in touch with artists? Here’s an organization that’s going to actually get people in contact. Even before 9 Evenings, they were thinking that way.
