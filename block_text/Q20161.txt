Martin: No. The idea was both Billy and Bob would go back to what they were doing before. They were both on the board of directors. Billy and Fred came into the office a lot and worked on finding engineers to answer artists’ requests. We began to have an open house on Sundays where the artists and engineers would come and meet each other. Billy was very active but they hired somebody to be the head of E.A.T. But that didn’t last very long.
