Martin: It seems it was integrated into the machine as one of the events triggered by the timer circuits that closed. So a circuit closed and I guess there was a resistor that heated up. Maybe Billy told him to put a resistor in there. Because the resistor would overheat and spark. Or it was a spark. I asked Per Biorn about this and he said that a simple overheating resistor, like the ones they used on some of the other elements of Homage, would not have been hot enough to set off the gunpowder. He would have had to have a resistor hooked to some kind of heating coil that would heat up and glow and that would be enough to set off the gunpowder.
