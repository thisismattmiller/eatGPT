Martin: I didn’t know. I think it was the Reuben Gallery [New York]? It’s documented. I can’t remember. [Note: It was at the Reuben Gallery.] But it was a space that they took over and he built those tunnels. The next piece after Whitman’s was Jim Dine’s Car Crash [1960], which I didn’t go to. I remember having the postcard for Car Crash on the wall in the hall of my apartment. But I wasn’t really in that world, but just beginning to be interested and to go to things through Whitman, primarily. Robert and I stayed friends with Simone and Bob and saw them from time to time. Whitman was married to Simone Forti at the time. I saw Whitman’s piece Flower in 1963.
 But I never saw Oldenburg’s series of performances at his Ray Gun Theater in early 1962, nor did I see the dance work going on at Judson [Memorial] Church [New York]. Judson Dance Theater was pretty separate from the performances at the Reuben Gallery, although there was some overlap, with Trisha Brown appearing in Whitman’s pieces, Mouth [1961] and Flower. Bob Rauschenberg was, of course, more involved in the dance performances at Judson Church. I remember Billy telling me that he tried to get Bob to go to one of the performances that were in the East Village—maybe Claes Oldenburg’s—but they turned back before getting there. However, Bob R. and Bob Whitman were friends during this period and it all came together, I think, with Steve Paxton and Alan [R.] Solomon producing the series First New York Theater Rally, in the spring of 1965, where Bob R. did Spring Training [1965] and Pelican [1963] and Bob Whitman did Night Time Sky [1965] and the dancers like Paxton, Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Trisha Brown presented works.
 I wasn’t doing very much—going to Columbia and not getting my degree and seeing a lot of art with Robert. After the blackout of November 1965, I began to live full-time at his place in Washington Square Village [New York].
