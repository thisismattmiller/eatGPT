NOTE ON THE TECHNIQUE: THE TECHNIQUE OF PRODUCING A PHOTOGRAPH ON THE PLEXIGLASS SURFACE PRESENTS VARIOUS PROBLEMS NOT EASILY SOLVABLE WITHIN THE NORMAL "STUDIO" CONTEXT. SPECIAL MATERIALS AND PROCESSES HAD TO BE DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THE COMBINATION OF CONTRAST WITH FULL TONAL RANGE WHICH THE ARTIST BELIEVES IS NECESSARY FOR THE IMAGE.
