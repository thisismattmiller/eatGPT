Beginning in January 1971, E.A.T. undertook a large-scale effort to assemble a major collection of 30 works by New York artists of the 1960s, raise funds to purchase the collection, and donate it to Moderna Museet in recognition of the museum’s long-time support of American art and artists. I remembered that Teledyne Corporation in California had worked with Rauschenberg on Mud Muse in a project with The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and I asked Teledyne to donate Mud Muse to the  collection. All the fall of 1971, the works were shown at the gallery building at 420 West  Broadway in New York and for the occasion we had a dinner at Rauschenberg’s for Princess Christina, who was the honorary patron of the collection. The New York Collection for Stockholm opened at Moderna Museet in October 1973 with 105 American guests attending the opening. Here we see Mud Muse bubbling, while in the  background are works by, among others, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Donald Judd, Frank Stella, Dan Flavin, George Segal, and Jim Dine.
