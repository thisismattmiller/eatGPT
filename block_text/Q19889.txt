Martin: No, let me think. I graduated college in 1960. So it would have been the summer of â€™60. Then I went to Columbia for one year. Then the next summer, 1961, I went to the Soviet Union as a guide on the USIA exhibition Plastics USA. I worked in the section Plastics in Art. That was mostly the summer. And I decided to go back to Columbia rather than go to Washington [D.C.] and join the government working on the Soviet Union. So I went back to Columbia.
