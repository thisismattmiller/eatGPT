LIGHT SCULPTURES {Light Sculptures}
 
 IN THESE SCULPTURES, THE REQUIRED SHARP, BRIGHT LIGHT BEAMS WERE OBTAINED BY USING HELIUM-NEON GAS LASERS {Helium-neon Gas Lasers}. THE BRIGHT RED LASER BEAM IS DIRECTED VERTICALLY UPWARDS NEAR THE ROOM CENTER WHERE IT STRIKES A RAPIDLY ROTATING MIRROR TILTED AT 45 DEGREES. THIS CAUSES THE LASER BEAM TO SWEEP HORIZONTALLY ABOUT THE ROOM, THEREBY DRAWING WHAT APPEARS TO BE A NARROW CONTINUOUS RED LINE ALONG THE WALLS. TO ACHIEVE A GROWING AND SHRINKING EFFECT, THE BEAM IS PARTIALLY INTERCEPTED BY CYLINDRICAL, RAMP-LIKE MASKS WHICH, AS THEY RISE OR FALL, INTERSECT A GROWING OR DECREAS- ING FRACTION OF THE ROTATING BEAM'S CIRCULAR ARC. TO ACHIEVE A RANDOMLY UNDULATING LINE OF LIGHT ALONG THE WALL, THE BEAM IS PASSED THROUGHA CLEAR GLASS CYLINDER WHICH HAS A SLIGHTLY RIPPLED SURFACE. THE SHAPE OF THIS UNDULATING LINE ALONG THE WALL CHANGES SLOWLY AS THE GLASS CYLINDER RISES OR FALLS.
