In 1989 Trisha Brown asked Bob Rauschenberg for a set for her dance Astral  Convertible, to be performed in an outdoor space. Rauschenberg and I discussed the project, and I brought engineer Per Biorn into the collaboration. We designed and Biorn built open towers on wheels in which battery-powered motorcycle headlights on the  towers face photocells on other towers so that the lights, and sound from tape recorders also located on the towers, are turned off and on as the dancers move among the towers.
