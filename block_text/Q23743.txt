For the engineer the contact with the artist could mean a dislocation or shift in the traditional way of working and thinking. The suggestions of the artists are derived from a different psychological background than those of the engineers. The stimulating influence that the contact with the artist has on the engineer benefits of course ultimately the industrial laboratory where the engineer works. Although the artist himself is not realizing or interested in practical applications of his ideas, the engineer is free to do so. As long as the artist may work freely within his own vision and can deal with the engineer in a realistic situation as required by the industry the cooperation has the possibility to be fruitful.
