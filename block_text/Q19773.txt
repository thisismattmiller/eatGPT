carriage discreteness
by: Yvonne Ranier
performance engineer: Per Biorn

A dance consisting of two separate but parallel (simultaneous) continuities and two separate (but equal) control systems. 1. Perform­er continuity controlled by me from a remote "plotting" table where I will spontane­ously choose the actions and placement of people and ob­jects (from a pre-determined list of possibilities) and com­municate those decisions to the 10-odd performers via walkie-talkie. 2. Event con­tinuity to be controlled by TEEM (theatre electronic en­vironment modular system) in its memory capacity. This part will consist of sequen­tial events that will include movie fragments, slide pro­jections, light changes, TV­ monitored close-ups of de­ tails in the dance-proper, tape recorded monologues and dialogues, and various photo-chemicaI phenomena, several involving ultra-violet light.
