Q: In terms of that invigorating effect—that impact on the engineer—do you think for Billy it was more a matter of being exposed to the process? Seeing the way the artist works? Where it’s not about the kind of corporate demands of Bell but it’s a different kind of process where it’s still problem-solving but you’re solving a different kind of problem. Or was it about the collaboration, people in different fields working together? And that has an impact on you because you think about what you do as an engineer in a different way. Or was it about the mindset? Was it more about the art that’s emerging from this stuff is changing the way the engineer potentially sees the world? Because it’s interactive art: you’re speaking into it, you’re hearing it, you’re walking through it. Do you see what I mean? Which—or is it all of those?
