 Mr. B. F. Waple - 3
 We would, of course, file on conclusion of this experiment, a full report on how the use of the communication authority we seek has made contributions to the overall experiment.
 We believe that the Commission will, in considering favorably this application, have provided an important public service in assisting in the demonstration of what we believe to be a significant bridge between Art and Technology. If there are any further questions which the Commission may have in regard to any aspect of the proposed experiment, please advise us. 
 Very truly yours,
 JILL JAKES (Director of the Foundation)
