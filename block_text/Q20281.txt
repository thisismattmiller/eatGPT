Q: What feels counterintuitive to me about it is that if you think about the artists in this generation, they are radically transgressing the boundaries between literature, dance, painting, sculpture—right? There’s never a place where Rauschenberg is saying, “I’m a painter. Yvonne, Trisha, you’re the dancers—” I wouldn’t want to do that. Rauschenberg is out there dancing. But with the engineers, I don’t get the sense that there’s a moment where he says, “Hey, you’re a painter too. You’re a dancer too. Come on in.” Where he said to Billy, “Come on and put on roller skates and get in the show.” That’s what seems—do you see what I mean? That seems counterintuitive. When I think about these artists as artists, part of what’s exciting about this moment is that there’s no division between writing and painting and sculpting and dancing. They’re all doing all of it to some degree. See what I mean?
