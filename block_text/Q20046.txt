Martin: Exactly. But that was the idea. Certainly things have changed for the artist in relation to his or her access to new materials. In those days, an artist who wanted to work with plastics—the industry would say, “We can give you a truckload but you can’t have one or two pieces of anything.” They were shut out from access to what Billy could see were developments in materials, developments in communication technology, this kind of thing. That was the idea— that the artist could get in through this human connection with an engineer, working with an engineer who had the knowledge. There was no reason for the artist to acquire this knowledge or training. This was the domain of the engineer who had spent his life learning his profession. They were artists, after all.
