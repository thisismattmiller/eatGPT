RAISON D'ETRE

The purpose of Experiments in Art and Technology is to assist and catalyze the inevitable active cooperation of industry, labor, technology and the arts. E.A.T. has assumed the responsibility of developing an effective method for collaboration between artists and engineers with industrial sponsorship.

The collaboration of artist and engineer under industrial sanction emerges as a revolutionary contemporary process. Artists and engineers are becoming aware of their crucial role in changing the human environment and the relevant forces shaping our society. Engineers are aware that the artists' insight can influence his direction and give human scale to his work, and the artist recognizes richness, variety and human necessity as qualities of the new technology.

The raison d'etre of E.A.T. is the possibility of a work which is not the preconception of either the engineer, the artist or industry but a result of the exploration of the human interaction between these three areas.
