Martin: I think that may be the clue that you’re looking. Some people like Ralph Flynn left Bell Labs and joined E.A.T. Robby Robinson got involved with Ted Kheel and was doing some projects with Ted Kheel. But for the others, the art wasn’t part of their lives. If you’re an artist and you were looking around for friends to walk across the stage, who did you ask? It’s not that you didn’t ask a scientist. It’s you didn’t know any of them. Billy may not have been available, or Billy may not have been the person that liked to perform. You know? You had to like it or you had to want to do it. I think this is it. I think that the social and the friendship didn’t meld.
