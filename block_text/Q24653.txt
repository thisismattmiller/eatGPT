Open Score, Robert Rauschenbergâ€™s piece for 9 Evenings, began with a tennis game on  the floor of the Armory. Bill Kaminski designed a miniature FM transmitter that fit in the  handle of the tennis racquet, and a contact microphone was attached to the handle of the  racquet with the antenna wound around the frame of the head. Each time Frank Stella and  Mimi Kanarek hit the ball the vibrations of the racquet strings were transmitted to the  speakers around the armory, and a loud BONG was heard. At each BONG, one of the 48  lights went out, and the game ended when the Armory was in complete darkness. Five  hundred people came on stage in the dark. Using infrared light and infrared television  cameras, their images were picked up and projected on three large screens suspended in  front of the audience. In a third section, Simone Forti, in a cloth sack, sang an Italian love  song as Rauschenberg picked her up and put her down at several places on the Armory  floor.
