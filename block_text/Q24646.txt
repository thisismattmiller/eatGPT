During the time I was working with Tinguely on Homage to New York, Robert  Rauschenberg asked me to collaborate on what he described as an interactive  environment. After many discussions, the idea boiled down to a sound environment  where the sounds from five AM radios emanate from five sculptures. The viewer can  vary the volume and the rate of scanning through the frequency band from knobs on the  control unit, but cannot stop the scanning at any one station. Rauschenberg wanted no  wires from the control unit to the other pieces, so that they could all be moved freely in  relation to one another. With the limited technology available in the early 1960â€™s, we  designed and built a system where all the AM radios were located in the control unit and  the sound was re-transmitted on the FM band to receivers and speakers in the other  pieces. Interference between the FM transmitters and noise from the scanning motors  were problems we had to solve. In this photograph Rauschenberg and I are working on  Oracle.
