In 1996 E.A.T. began a film restoration and presentation project, using archival 16 mm film and reel-to-reel tape recordings that I had arranged to be shot and recorded during the 9 Evenings. The material was transferred to video. Swedish filmmaker Barbro Schultz Lundestam is editing the material to present each artists’ original work as fully as possible. The films will also include a documentary section of still photographs, artists’ notes, and interviews with artists and engineers. The photograph above was taken from the screen of a television monitor during the editing of Öyvind Fahlström’s work, Kisses  Sweeter Than Wine, and shows characters Fahlström called ‘Chinese Sparrows’ swinging  from long swings attached to the ceiling of the Armory.  
 I am grateful to the following people who helped me in realizing this exhibition: Jill  Krauskopf Gellene, Julie Martin, Hedi Sorger, and John Tormey. The panels were produced at Applied Image, Farmingdale, N.J.
