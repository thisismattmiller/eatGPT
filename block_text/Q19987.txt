But if it would come about that certain things wouldn’t work, then the engineer might say, “It doesn’t exactly work this way but how about this?” Then the idea was that it would be a dialogue. The engineer wouldn’t contribute art, god forbid. But he would contribute a solution that might change the look or make the piece work slightly differently.
