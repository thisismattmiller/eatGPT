Martin: Huge. It was a 5,000-square-foot loft. In the front they built a little partitioned-off office. It was like the administrative office. Then they built a wall almost all the way across the back. Maybe not a third but a fourth of the way into the space. There was a largish opening in the wall. All the technical stuff was in the back with storage and workbenches and things.
