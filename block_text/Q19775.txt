Bandoneon !, (bandoneon the production of visual factorial), is a combine incoporating programmed audio circuits, moving loudspeakers, tv images and lighting, instrumentally excited.
The instrument, a bandoneon, will create signals whic are simultaneously used as material for differentiated audio spectrums (achieved through modulation means, and special loudspeaker construction), for the production of visual images, devised by Lowell Cross; for the activation of programming devices controlling the audio visual environment, devised by Bob Kieronski ("Vochrome," and programmed patchboard) and Fred Waldhauer (Proportional Control).

Bandoneon ! uses no composing means; when activated it composes itself out of its own composite instrumental nature.
