Gentlemen:
On behalf of the Tekniska Museet and Dagens Nyheter we wish to express our appreciation and sincere gratitude for all your interested efforts and hard work, you have devoted to engineer all kinds of new and brilliant projects for the Festival of Art and Technology. Though the Festival will not take place in Stockholm which we regret very deeply we are convinced that your work will prove to be a fruitful contribution to the advancement of both Art and Technology. With the Festival now being launched in the New York Armory rich in traditions we hope that the event will be a great succes, and that this will give you full compensation for the frustrating difficulties entangled in the Stockholm project. We wish you good luck. Should you happen to pass through Stockholm in the future, don't hesitate to get in touch with us
