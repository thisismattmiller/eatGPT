In a silent space Soundings is a mirror, eight feet high and thirty-six feet long. Behind the  partially mirrorized front layer are two layers of plexiglass with images of wooden chairs  silkscreened on them. Different lights behind the sheets of plexiglass are triggered by sounds in the room so that sets of lights go on, and illuminated images of chairs are seen through the mirror. Technically, Soundings works by having the sound signal from  microphones hung in front of the panels split into four frequency bands, chosen to  correspond to the pitch of different human voices. The signal from each frequency band  controls a set of nine 150-watt spotlights, and the brightness of the lights varies in intensity based on the volume of the sound. Thus, one frequency band activates nine lights throughout the piece; and soft sounds will produce a low light level.
