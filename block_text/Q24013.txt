-2- THEME was designed to fill the requirements of ten artists' specific theatrical situations. It consists of 289 components portable electronic - amplifiers, equalizers, transmitters, receivers, distant control equipment, and proportional control equipment. It permits simultaneous remote control of multiple sounds, lights, and movements of objects. Various aspects of THEME will be utilized by all of the participating artists, either alone or in conjunction with special technical units required by individual artists. The reason for the impromptu tennis game, for example, was to test the frequency of the sound of a tennis ball hitting the racquet, which Robert Rauschenberg will use to stimulate a visual reaction through the system. Later in the same piece, however, independently operated television equipment will also play a key role. One of the most significant aspects of the system is its versatile proportional control system, which can be used as a portable electronic dimmer board, in itself an engineering first. It was developed especially for the pieces by David Tudor and Deborah Hay. Tickets for the nine performances will be priced at $3 each. Ticket information will be available after September 20 by calling 689-3315 (area code 212). NOTE: A full press release is in progress and a date and time will be announced shortly when members of the press may meet with some of the artists and scientists.
