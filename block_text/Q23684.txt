THIS SCULPTURE, 15 FEET HIGH, IN THE FORM OF A T-SHAPED "DRAINPIPE" IS TO BE MOUNTED OVER REFRIGERATING APPARATUS AND IS PROPOSED IN RESPONSE TO AN INVITATION TO EXHIBIT IN THE VATICAN PAVILION AT THE SAN ANTONIO HEMISFAIR, APRIL 1968. MADE OF METAL, IT IS TO ACCUMULATE ICE AND, THEREBY, ADD TO OR CREATE ITS OWN FORM. I IMAGINE THE SCULPTURE LIT UP IN DARKENED AND COOL, AIR-CONDITIONED SURROUNDINGS.
