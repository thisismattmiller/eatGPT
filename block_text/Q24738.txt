The original four artists wanted to cover the dome, which had been decided on before we became involved, with a cloud and asked Japanese artist Fujiko Nakaya to create it. We had already rejected chemical means of producing fog: carbon dioxide for environmental reasons and urea for public relations ones. Nakaya found cloud physicist Tom Mee in Pasadena, who designed a nozzle system for her. Water under pressure of 500 psi is pushed through an orifice 10 mil in diameter and hits a small pin which breaks the water into droplets tiny enough to remain suspended in air. The system for the Pavilion consisted of 2,520 jet-spray nozzles organized in 10-foot strands of plastic pipe with one  nozzle every foot, placed in the ridges and valleys on the top section of the roof. The system could generate a 6-foot thick 150-foot diameter area of low-hanging cloud. This required 41 tons of water per hour, and we had to build a small reservoir to continually feed the system. Nakaya took this photograph the first day she had the cloud system turned on full. The Expo fire brigade showed up, but much to their relief found only what  they called ‘water smoke.’
