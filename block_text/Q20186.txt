Martin: It attracted engineers and began to make publicity for this idea. By the summer of 1968, we received so many applications and works of art to the competition, more than 160 works, that once Pontus had chosen the few works he wanted for his show at MoMA, we decided to show all the submitted works at the same time. We approached the Brooklyn Museum and they had space available—this would never be possible today. Bob showed Oracle at MoMA. He didn’t have a work at Brooklyn but he came up with the title of the exhibition, Some More Beginnings[: Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), 1968–69], and helped Billy and me come up with the idea of a completely non-hierarchical catalogue. We printed it on a huge web press in Denville, New Jersey. In those days they made screened images called veloxes that were used on the printing plate so we had two veloxes of each work made, one with the art-type information as a caption and the other grayed down with the technical information about the work superimposed on the image. Then Billy and I laid all these veloxes out on a long roll of paper at the printers and cut every 11 inches (the width of the page). Some artists were upset when the image of their piece was cut in half, but every work was treated the same and it was non-hierarchical.
