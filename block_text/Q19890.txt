Martin: Right. I went to undergraduate Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and studied philosophy. I did my thesis on [Karl] Marx and [Ludwig] Feuerbach and the theory of alienation. But I was getting more and more interested in the Soviet Union and I took a couple of courses on Russia and the Soviet Union at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. I canâ€™t remember what they are right at this moment, though I do remember auditing the famous course that was usually taught by Merle Fainsod but that year was being taught by Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later came to the Russian Institute at Columbia [University, New York]. So I decided to go to graduate school for Russian studies. Rather than stay at Harvard, I decided to go to Columbia, to the Russian Institute. In those days, it was pretty easy to get fellowships. The government was giving out fellowships to study the Soviet Union. So I think they paid me to go, or at least the tuition. As I remember.
