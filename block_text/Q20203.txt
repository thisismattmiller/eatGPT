Martin: Well, I don’t know. I shouldn’t say that. I don’t want to say that. But actually, he resigned as chairman at one point during this time—early seventies. I think just other things were pressing on him. Maybe this is when he moved to Florida. I don’t know exactly when but sometime about this time. He just felt he couldn’t fulfill the obligations of being chairman.
