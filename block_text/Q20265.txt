Martin: Liking the color, yes. It was more that it wasn’t making this decision. It was like saying, “This is what I’ve got. Is it okay?” And then Bob saying, “Yes. It’s okay.”
 Larry Owens, who worked on the control console for the Pepsi Pavilion, was very much an engineer who didn’t understand and didn’t respect the needs of the artist. He didn’t try. He worked with Fred and David Tudor on the sound system and when David asked for more channels he would could come back to him and say, “Look, all the system will hold is eight.” For Billy and Fred, you don’t say eight is enough if the artist is saying, “Can we get more?” Or, “Can I have more?” So it’s about stretching yourself.
