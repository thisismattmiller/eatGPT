PROCESSING OF ARTISTS' TECHNICAL REQUESTS

Matching Engineers and Artists:

An administrator will receive and initially sort the artists' requests into areas of needed technical guidance. Members of the engineering Standing Committee will examine the requests at regular intervals and suggest matches between engineers and artists. They will then place the request with a project engineer.

Actions of the Project Engineer:

The project engineer will contact the artist to discuss the project and provide information. He will acknowledge meeting the artist by sending a brief report on the project to E.A.T. At this point he will then either (1) help the artist if he can, or (2) write it up as a project for industry and forward it to the Standing Committee. The project engineer will become the promoter of the project in guiding it through industry.

INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS

Industrial Projects can be dealt with as follows:

Artists meet with engineers on a single visit basis.

Artists reside on industrial premises for a predetermined period.

Production of a work according to artists specifications.

If the Supporting Member company cannot finance the artists' request, E.A.T. will seek funds for the project.
