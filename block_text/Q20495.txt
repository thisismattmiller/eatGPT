Q: I had a couple of other small questions and then we can try to talk about politics. Just thinking, moving from the sixties into the seventies, how would you evaluate the impact of E.A.T. on the art scene? Do you feel like it reverberated out and had a real impact on the way visual artists and performers thought about what they were doing?
