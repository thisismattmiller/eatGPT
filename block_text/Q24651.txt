9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering opened on October 13, 1966, at the 69th Regiment  Armory, a huge space on Lexington Avenue at 25th Street in New York City. The art  community in New York became involved in helping us with 9 Evenings, as fellow  artists, dancers, musicians, and performers volunteered their time for setting up and  trouble shooting, and then appeared in the performances. A high-powered, but slightly  distorted publicity campaign resulted in more than 1500 people each night attended the  performances, many of them unprepared for the avant-garde performances they saw. In  this photograph the crowd is entering the Armory on opening night. The 9 EVENINGS  poster, designed by Rauschenberg, hangs on either side of the entrance, and an Army  transport truck sits on the street, displaced from its usual parking place on the Armory  floor.
