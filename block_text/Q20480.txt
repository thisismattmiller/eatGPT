Q: And in terms of the collaborative aspect, just to go back to that, what we were talking about before was his idea that you would be in the same room working on projects together, calling over every few minutes, “Oh, look at this.” Or was it that he would say to Billy, “Go off and do this and go do it on your own and come back a week later with something?” Was collaboration actually working together, or was it go off and do your thing and I’ll do mine?
