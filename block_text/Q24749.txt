E.A.T. developed an international communications project called Telex: Q&A, as a  contribution to Pontus Hulten’s exhibition on the Paris Commune, “Utopia and Visions: 1871-1981.” We linked four public spaces by telex: Automation House in New York, Moderna Museet in Stockholm, the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad, India, and a large exhibition space at the Sony building in Tokyo. Visitors were invited to ask people in other countries questions about 1981, ten years into the future. The questions from each site were sent to all other sites and anyone, expert or layman, could answer the questions about the future. 
 This photograph shows the large public environment at the Tokyo telex site organized by Fujiko Nakaya, where people could come and read the telexes from all over the world and then send their own questions or answers, and have their pictures taken for the  project poster, which she printed at the end of the exhibition.
