Martin: Yes. I mean, the early days, it was mostly about E.A.T.—the plans, ongoing activities like talks at industries, open houses, what we were doing, asking people to sign up as members. I know there’s a very funny notice where Billy says, “Would you please fill out the artist’s application slip? Little names on little pieces of paper are not too easy for our engineers to decipher.” So it was getting the organization going and articulating what should be done. He and Bob worked very closely together on a lot of these things. Billy always trusted Bob’s aesthetics, so to speak, or his operational aesthetics. In the first three issues of E.A.T. News they wrote the goals of E.A.T. and in the first months hammered out ideas of collaboration and what the organization would concentrate on. Billy very much collaborated with him or would ask him, “This? Should we do this? Should we do this?” He would ask Bob to design the heading of the E.A.T. News. Bob chose the E.A.T. font. “How should we do it?” This kind of thing. They worked closely together on this I think.
