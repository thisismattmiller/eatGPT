Martin: Yes. How the hell did it work? This is the thing that’s so interesting about oral history, right? You’ve done the same narrative and the same level. But you have to go, “How do you get deeper to facts and to more detail? How do you get more detail?” What ends up getting lost in history? Who knows?
 I think the boundaries were still there. The radical boundaries were the ones within art. I think that’s the thing. But the boundary between art and non-art were still there. It’s blurred now because the guy that writes the program—is he the artist? Or is the artist [the one] that used the program? It’s, unfortunately, blurring. Being an older generation, I’m not so sure it’s a good idea. There is this dancer [Liz Lerman]. This person did something at MSU [Montclair State University, New Jersey]. She had a physics professor be on stage doing something. I didn’t think it was that interesting. But again, for the physicist, on a personal level it may have changed him.
