Martin: No, during the 9 Evenings there wasn’t time for that kind of thinking. There was the need to get things done. Everybody was working all the time. Artists, engineers, friends. Getting everything to work. It was a bit insane, looking back on it, that they planned to have two different artists each night so there had to be new setups during intermission. The engineers had planned for that to some extent by developing the TEEM [Theatrical Electronic Environmental Module], a modular control system that the different performances could plug into. But there were the physical setups as well. Of course, there was the excitement that the collaborations between artists and engineers was working. The works were being shown to a larger audience than they had ever been before—more than fifteen hundred people each night. But the demands of the performances overrode everything else.
 For me, the intellectual excitement came later when it was more the idea that this was something really worth doing. No, I remember somehow, at one point, maybe being out in Berkeley Heights, talking with Billy—maybe when he was talking about my coming to work for him. I remember specifically the idea that the collaboration between artists and engineers not only benefits the artists but also could benefit the engineers and the development of technology. And wow, I remember thinking that idea was amazing. That same sense of something intellectually thrilling—like hearing Castro, right? Always seduced by ideas. And I remember coming back to my apartment on Thompson Street and telling, very specifically, my boyfriend at the time who was an actor, Danny Goldman, how exciting these ideas were and how appealing the possibilities of these ideas were. There definitely was a moral dimension and idealistic dimension to these ideas.
