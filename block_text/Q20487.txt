Q: Would you say that these qualities that youâ€™re sketching for us are ones that Billy had, too? I wonder about the depth of their relationship. Because Billy worked with a number of artists.
 With Warhol and Jasper Johns. But my impression is that his relationship with Rauschenberg was especially close and continued over decades. What was the glue of their relationship? What did they like about each other? Why did they get along so well?
