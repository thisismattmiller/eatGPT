Q: Let me ask you a little bit more about your own life. Then I did want to ask you some of your sense of Billy’s history—his history going a little further back—of collaboration. But to stick with your story for a minute, would the first time you would have seen Rauschenberg in person, or seen a work by Rauschenberg, have been at that benefit for Jonas Mekas in December of ’65 when you went to see the Whitman and the Oldenburg and the Rauschenberg piece? Would that have been your first encounter with Rauschenberg?
