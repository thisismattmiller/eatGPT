John Cage made Variations V in 1965 for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. He  and David Tudor settled on two systems for the sound to be affected by movement. For  the first, my colleagues and I set up a system of directional photocells aimed at the stage  lights, so that the dancers triggered sounds as they cut the light beams with their  movements. A second system used a series of antennas. When a dancer came within four  feet of an antenna a sound would result. Ten photocells were wired to activate tape recorders and short-wave radios. Cecil Coker designed a control circuit, which was built  by my assistant Witt Wittnebert. Film footage by Stan VanDerBeek and Nam June Paikâ€™s  manipulated television images were projected on screens behind the dancers. In this  photograph Variations V is performed for a television taping session in Hamburg. The  photocells were located at the base of the five-foot antennas placed around the stage.  Cage, Tudor, and Gordon Mumma operate equipment to modify and determine the final  sounds.
