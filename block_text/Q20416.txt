Q: Well, let me ask you one more question about this same topic. And then let’s get to E.A.T. Going back to the Tinguely, even, I’m interested in how Billy sees his role as an engineer. And going back to the Tinguely collaboration, my understanding is that Billy wasn’t just making circuits and arranging explosives and timers but he was, to a certain degree, scavenging in dumps in New Jersey. So where’s the limit for Billy’s—of the engineer’s—role? Where is it distinguished from the artist’s role? Was there a point where Billy would say, I don’t feel like I should be deciding which bicycle is the right one to bring back from the dump? Or was that a question in his mind at that point, do you think?
