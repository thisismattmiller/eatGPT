This way of working in groups is more and more in the air globally. In the 50's we already had the Once Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the Gutai Group in Osaka and Tokyo. Now as one travels around he encounters groups so to speak wherever he goes: the Zaj Group in Madrid, Fluxus, here and abroad, Bang3 in Richmond, Virginia, the recent construction in Stockholm of the Hon by Niki de St. Phalle, Jean Tinguely and Per Ulveldt.
