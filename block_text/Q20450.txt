Q: Coming back to the engineering and art connection, is it your sense—I should have asked you this before—that it’s unprecedented? In the 1920s, you think of something like Ballet Mécanique [1923–24]. A composer like Stravinsky or Satie, they could have been hanging out with engineers, but is your sense that this is the first time that you really had somebody from a place like a Bell Labs, a person like a Billy, coming into an art scene and working directly with artists? Did it ever happen before?
