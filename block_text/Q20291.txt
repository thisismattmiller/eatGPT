Martin: Number one, there’s not that big of—well, there was, between, say, dancers and artists. I mean, artists had made sets for dancers. That kind of collaborating on a project—the project of the dance. Bob says he was forced into being a choreographer only because of the mistake on the announcement—he asked first Per Olof Ultvedt, who was a Swedish sculptor visiting New York, and then Alex Hay, who also was not a dancer. He asked Carolyn Brown, who was a superb dancer. He was working within the field of dance. It’s true. Given the fact that they were all friends and they were all in each other’s pieces and in each other’s lives, it doesn’t—I mean, looking out maybe as a theorist, you see it as radical. It was a gradual process from the fifties. You know, Black Mountain [College, North Carolina], they put on theatricals. People performed in other people’s pieces, right?
