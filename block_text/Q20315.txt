Martin: Yes. Utopian. I see now, more and more, E.A.T. as so much a part of this whole utopian fervor of the sixties—of political, social, civil rights, and later women’s rights. It was the manifestation in the art world—or at least in this part of the art world—of those idealistic utopian ideals. I didn’t think about it that way then, although, being part of it, now when I begin to look back and to write about it, I think about it like that—very much so.
