The E.A.T. competition generated more than 140 submissions from all over the world,  and we decided to show all these works. “Some More Beginnings: Experiments in Art  and Technology,” which was the first major art and technology exhibition, opened at the Brooklyn Museum in November 1968. In this photo Peter Poole demonstrates Fakir in 3/4 Time by Niels and Lucy Young, which won a prize in the E.A.T. competition. On the same principle as a lariat, a loop of cotton ribbon held by vacuum to a rotating axle, moves 100 mph along itself, forming a standing stationary shape in space.
