The involvement by the artist with industrial laboratories must to make sense benefit both parties. The industry must be able to count on the possibility of profit and the artist must be able to realize his work. A practical way to deal with this situation may be similar to the way contracts are allowed Universities by the government for research. The industrial laboratory could give the artist a contract which would allow the artist the possibility to realize his ideas in co- operation with the engineer. The equipment built would belong to the artist or an appropriate Foundation, the practical ideas and patenets that result would belong to the industry.
