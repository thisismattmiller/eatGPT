Martin: Well, ultimately Billy and Fred. I remember meeting Billy and Fred, who asked if I would come work for them to be editor of the E.A.T. News. By that time, they had the loft at 9 East Sixteenth Street and Billy had put out a couple of issues of the newsletter, I’m pretty sure. The first one I worked on—where my name appears as editor—was volume 1, number 3, published on November 1, 1967. But I recently saw that in the previous newsletter that came out June 1, 1967, there is a note that that issue had been put together by Billy, Fred, and Bob R. and with the next issue I would take over as “regular editor.” So I must have been on board or planning to be on board during that summer.
 In the spring of ’67 I was working with Merrill Brockway at CBS and we did one of the segments of his documentary on Bob and on the Revolvers. In those days, you were sort of around. Something happened, you would help or you would maybe volunteer, or you know to go to something.
