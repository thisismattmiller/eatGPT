Q: It seems he must have been driven and focused because he produced such an enormous amount in such a remarkable range of media. But he seems to have been a really socially remarkable figure, too. He wasn’t a recluse who goes into the studio and shuts the door. He seems to have been so open to interaction and collaboration and hanging out with people, working with other people. Is that an accurate impression? Is that the way you’d describe him?
