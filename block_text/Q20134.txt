Martin: Yes, fifty-year. It seems like E.A.T. was founded once the group decided to do the performances in New York. It was for tax-exempt purposes, really, to allow people to contribute money and get a tax deduction. It was founded September 26, 1966, before the 9 Evenings, to function as a tax-exempt organization for donations to the 9 Evenings. But of course, it takes a long time to get a tax-exempt certificate from the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] so the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts continued to be what we now call a fiscal sponsor.
