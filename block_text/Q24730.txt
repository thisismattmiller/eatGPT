In the spring of 1968, E.A.T. organized a series of thirty lecture-demonstrations by engineers and scientists for artists, held at the E.A.T. loft at 9 East 16th Street. The lectures covered such technical subjects as lasers and holography; computer generated  sound and images; color theory; paper; television; and new Hexcelâ„¢ materials. Speakers came from academic, industrial and government laboratories such as, Bell Laboratories, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, National Bureau of Standards, Eastman-Kodak, Columbia University, IBM, and Union Camp Company. In this photograph, Herwig Kogelnik, who did some of the fundamental work on lasers at Bell Laboratories in  Murray Hill, N.J., gives a lecture on lasers and holography.
