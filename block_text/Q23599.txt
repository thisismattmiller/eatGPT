RAISON D'ETRE
 The purpose of Experiments in Art and Technology is to ASSIST + catalyze the inevitable active [involvement] COOPERATION of industry, LABOR, technology and the arts. E.A.T. has assumed the responsibility of [developing] ORGANIZING an effective [collaborative relationship] METHOD BF COLLABORATION between artists and engineers. WITH THE SPONSORSHIP OF IND.
 The collaboration of artist and engineer under industrial sanction [does not fill a sociological need or void but] emerges as a revolutionary contemporary process. ARTISTS + Engineers are becoming aware of their crucial role in changing the human environment. AND [The artist, in turn, desires to create within the technological world in order to satisfy the traditional involvement of the artist] with the relevant forces shaping OUR society. Engineers [have perceived how] ARE AWARE THAT the artists' insight can influence his direction and give human scale to his work and the artist recognizes richness, [multiplicity] VARIETY and human necessity as qualities of the new technology.
 The raison d'etre of E.A.T. is the possibility of a work which is not the preconception of either the engineer, the artist or industry but a result of the exploration of the human interaction between these three areas.
