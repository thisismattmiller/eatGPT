 The purpose of Experiments in Art and Technology, Inc. is to catalyze the inevitable active involvement of industry, technology, and the arts. E.A.T. has assumed the responsibility of developing an effective collaborative relationship between artists and engineers.
 E.A.T. will guide the artist in achieving new art through new technology and work for the professional recognition of the engineer's technical contribution within the engineering community.
 Engineers are becoming aware of their crucial role in changing the human environment. Engineers who have become involved with artist's projects have perceived how the artist's insight can influence his directions and give human scale to his work. The artist in turn desires to create within the technological world in order to satisfy the traditional involvement of the artist with the revelant forces shaping society. The collaboration of artist and engineer emerges as a revolutionary contemporary sociological process. 
 Initially, a successful working relationship between artists and engineers will require that each operate freely within his own environment. The function of E.A.T. is to create an intersection of these environments. 
 To ensure a continued fruitful interaction between a rapidly advancing technology and the arts, E.A.T. will work for a high standard of technical innovation in collaborative projects.
 E.A.T. is founded on the strong belief that an industrially sponsored, effective working relationship between artists and engineers will lead to new possibilities which will benefit society as a whole.
