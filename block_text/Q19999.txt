Martin: Billy’s. He saw technology as offering a new palette. This is from somebody from outside the art world. Another element in Billy’s thinking from the beginning was the idea of the individual could influence the larger systems he was contributing to, the idea of the individual taking responsibility for his work. He wrote about this in 1960 in a piece he published in Alfred Leslie’s Hasty Papers [1960], a “Fragment on Man and the System.” In his early collaborations with [Jean] Tinguely and Bob R., he saw in particular that the artist takes full responsibility for his work, and by working with engineers, it would encourage the engineer to take responsibility for the systems he was working on. Billy soon came to feel that it was the engineer who needed to work with the artist. That the engineer could benefit in his professional capacity through working with the artist. Not in the way of discovering new equipment or technical ideas but in using his knowledge in a new situation and enriching his own way of working. The engineer could offer the artist a new palette but the artists could offer the engineer a new sense of possibilities in his work as well. Billy said it was Bob [Rauschenberg] who articulated this idea of collaboration in the sense of individuals working one-to-one. Billy developed it and articulated it but he has always said that it started with Bob—Bob always talked about collaborating with his materials even earlier—before there were other people involved in the mix. This whole idea of a collaboration of equals very much came out of Bob. Or let’s say Billy’s working with Bob.
 Although, he saw in his work—and he’s written about that. Do you know his piece, The Garden Party [1960]?
