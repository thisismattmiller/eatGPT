Martin: Yes. Fred was more hands-on technical. He was one of the people designing the digital switching system, the T1 [transmission] system, working on developing that. And later he developed the first digital hearing aid. He had the idea. He said he realized it when he was driving his rattley Toyota, that no matter how loud he made the sound, you couldnâ€™t hear the jazz he was playing. He realized it was about which frequencies need to be amplified. His mother was going deaf as well so he had that experience. He realized that it was the frequencies and if you could tune a hearing aid to raise the frequencies that were missing in the ear that it would be more effective.
