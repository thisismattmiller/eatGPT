Martin: Yes. When Steve Paxton organized the First New York Theater Rally in the spring of 1965 all three participated. Bob R. did Spring Training; Whitman did Night Time Sky; and Oldenburg did Washes [1965]. So it was probably logical for Brockman to ask the three to participate in a benefit performance night. Most of this is documented so somebody else wonâ€™t have trouble finding the details. Whitman did this incredible piece, Prune Flat. Rauschenberg did Map Room II [1965]. Oldenburg did Moveyhouse [1965].
