We need the following information for the coordination of the ceiling and lighting. Would you please fill out the diagrams as directed and return them to us immediately (so we'll have them tomorrow).

Ceiling Diagram
Put a mark on the floor diagram corresponding to the location where an object is to hang or come from the ceiling. On an adjoining paper would you give a description of the object and its direction of movement, if any.

Lighting
We need an estimate of how many lights you will need, of what type and the Watts. (All lights must be 110 voits.) If you have any special lighting effects and problems, please list these in detail. (This is to enable the engineers to make the system adequate to handle your lighting).

Projection Diagram
Show plans for TV, slide and movie projections, if any.

Tickets
Number of complimentary tickets desired (if possible).
