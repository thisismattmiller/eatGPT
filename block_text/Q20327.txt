Martin: Right. This kind of idealism is probably needed more than ever, in a sense. The problems facing us—the environment, global warming—seem more intractable. There’s less technological optimism. Some of the things that made E.A.T. possible have changed, like a kind of generosity. I think it was easier to live. Living took less money. There was more free time. There was more sense for the engineer that he could come work with an artist and get some sort of satisfaction but not necessarily be paid. Everything didn’t have to be on a paying basis. Now life is really hard, right? It’s very hard. But I do think young artists with their friends volunteer and do the same thing. But I think the time has passed in the sense that that kind of openness and freedom within society for people to volunteer may have passed—a kind of generosity. It may not be possible anymore in that sense but I think the need for this kind of collaboration and the value of it is still valid.
 There’s a young man, Philip Ording. Actually, he’s a mathematician—a topologist—and he’s working with artists now. He worked with Richard Serra on some ideas about what forms will stand up or won’t. He’s worked with Anthony McCall on programming shapes with Anthony’s light pieces and with other artists. He says that it’s made him be able to think more three- dimensionally about the knot problems he works on in his own work. He’s a model of the kind of thing E.A.T. was talking about in the sixties. You work with the artist. You work on problems in your area for the artist who comes back to you in your profession. I think it still is a valuable thing. I just don’t necessarily think putting a physicist on stage directing people is, but, you don’t know. Because who knows? Personally, for him as a person, as a growing experience—I can criticize it from my point of view, but I can also de- criticize it.
