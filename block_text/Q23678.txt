THE DOPPLER SONAR WORKS ON EXACTLY THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS A POLICE RADAR WHICH DETECTS SPEEDERS. BOTH DEVICES PRODUCE OUTPUTS WHICH ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE SPEED OF AN OBJECT IN THE BEAM. THE PRINCIPLE DIFFERENCES ARE THAT, WHILE THE RADAR TRANSMITS RADIOWAVES AND DISPLAYS SPEED AS A READING ON A METER, THE SONAR TRANSMITS ULTRASONIC WAVES AT 70 KHz AND DISPLAYS SPEED AS THE PITCH OF AN AUDIBLE SOUND TONE. THE HIGHER THE SPEED, THE HIGHER PITCH. ALSO THE HIGHER AND CLOSER THE MOVING OBJECT THE LOUDER THE TONE.
