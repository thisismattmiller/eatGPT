Dear Vera:

In our telephone conversation the other day you asked for more information on the 1966 Festival of Theater and Engineering. I hope this will give you a clear idea of what we are doing.

"We" are 10 New York artists:

Lucinda Childs - choreographer, dancer
John Cage - composer, writer
Oyvind Fahlstrom - painter, poet
Alex Hay - painter, choreographer
Deborah Hay - choreographer, dancer
Claes Oldenburg - painter, happening-author
Steve Paxton - choreographer, dancer
Robert Whitman - sculptor, happening-author
David Tudor - musician

and myself. All the artists have exhibited/performed their works here in the past and all are artists of great reputation and daring. We are all involved in our own individual ways of experimenting with modern technology and exploring the possibilities of the interaction between art and professional technology.

Since last January we have been working steadily with about 30 engineers from Bell Laboratories led by Billy Kl√ºver, the technical engineer for Tinguely, Johns and others. The artists suggested ideas and problems for performance situations and the engineers came up with ingenious technical solutions. In the spring we began building equipment and now we have almost all the devices completed. The cooperation of the artists and scientists has produced very exciting and POSITIVE achievements.

Originally we were to perform in a Festival of Art and Technology in Stockholm this September. However, serious differences arose between our Swedish sponsor and ourselves in attitude and approach toward the Festival. These conflicts prevented the rapport necessary for this large scale international project. Although the cancellation of the Stockholm arrangements was a rough setback, the American artists and scientists refused to lose the courage of their commitment. Together we have resolved to make a success of the Festival here in New York.
