Q: Well, it’s interesting. Maybe it is a generational issue because it does feel counterintuitive to me. The other way I’d put it is that I associate this generation of artists with not just destroying the boundaries between art forms but destroying the pretense of expertise. Think of Steve Paxton or Yvonne Rainer and the insistence on the pedestrian. You don’t have to be trained as a dancer. Not to perform in some of Steve’s pieces but to have the idea, to work with ideas of movement in space. To choreograph the pieces, you had to be a choreographer—a professional.
