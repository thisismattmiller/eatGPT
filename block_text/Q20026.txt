Martin: Then Kristian was born in September ’67. The summer of 1967 I was working for Christophe, organizing a second Midsummer series. She invited Bob Whitman to do another piece, called Shirt. I don’t remember too much about it. It took place in the woods of the artist Constantino Nivola, who was a friend of Christophe’s. Terry [M.] Riley and Trisha Brown also did pieces that summer in a tent set up next to Nivola’s studio. Toward the end of those performances, Billy—and maybe Bob R. was with him, must have been—came out to Christophe’s and I remember sitting on the beach and talking about E.A.T. and what to do. I wasn’t working for them yet. Then I came back to the city from working on Midsummer. I worked for Channel Thirteen—again I put my Russian Institute knowledge to use and worked on the Russian Revolution. I was doing research for a few weeks. Soon after this, sometime during the fall of 1967, Billy and [Frederick D.] Fred [Waldhauer] asked me to come to work at E.A.T. as editor of the newsletter. The first issue of the E.A.T. News where I was listed as editor was published November 1, 1967. Certainly from then on, I worked for E.A.T.
