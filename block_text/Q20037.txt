Martin: Right. It was about the breakdown of the great computer running the whole society. So Billy was very interested in educational films. When he first came to this country in 1954, he tried to sell the idea of producing educational films on a college level. He had made an English translation of the Motion of Electrons film to show in the U.S. and tried to get his idea produced. He went to Encyclopedia Britannica, who was the major maker of educational films, and they said, “No, no. We do grade school and high school films. It will never work on the higher level.” I think he went to Hollywood and talked to people there too.
 He had this interest in working with education, with technology. As he began to work as an engineer, he increasingly realized the limitations in many of his fellow engineers’ thinking and wanted to break them. He says at some point—I don’t remember where he’s written it—he began to see the artist as a vehicle, this kind of revolutionary vehicle. That the artist, in working with the engineer, could change the engineer’s idea about what he or she was doing. I think that idea he had was very strong with him. I think Bob liked it and picked up on it. But I think Bob was very much still in the art world.
