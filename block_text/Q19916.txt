Martin: No, no. My parents came to visit New York once or twice a year. Yes, they liked to. They came to New York. I remember one time we also went toâ€”it was a big Picasso exhibition where he was in every floor of the Museum of Modern Art and then several galleries around New York. They collected a lot of art locally and our house was filled with paintings and drawings of new young local artists. They did buy some Picasso prints and ceramics over the years. Particularly after I left they were more active that way. But again, none of those debates.
