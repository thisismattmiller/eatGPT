Martin: Yes, 9 Evenings. It became a completely different piece. When Bob [Whitman] looked at the armory space, he got the idea to use the cars. The military was still parking vehicles on the armory floor. You see them parked outside the armory on Lexington Avenue in some of the photos of the opening night. He had seven cars, each carrying either film or television projectors, drive out onto the armory floor and park facing the back wall that was covered with white paper. On the balcony, television cameras shot live performances: two girls moving slowly in front of a curved mirror, a girl typing, a small fiber optic camera inside a coat pocket. Whitman fed images of these live performances and off-air television images to the television projectors in the cars. He also cued the drivers to turn on the films of nature subjects like the eagles and the penguins.
