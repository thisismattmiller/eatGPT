In Steve Paxtonâ€™s work, Physical Things, a polyethylene air-inflated structure occupied  most of the Armory floor and a tower rose to the peak of the Armory roof. The audience  walked through the structure, encountering slide projections, sounds and performers.  Emerging from the structure, they used small receivers to hear different sounds broadcast  from wire loops suspended in a net overhead.
