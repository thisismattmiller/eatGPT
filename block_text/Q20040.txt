Martin: E.A.T., right. So that’s sort of an example. I think the irony that, since certain facets of the technology have gone that way of breaking down monolithic technological systems—and with the cell phone, with the personal computer, the internet—the individual has gotten access to movie-making, music-making, et cetera, and communication. We have access to vast new sources of information. Some of the ideas stated in the early aims of E.A.T. have come to fruition. Technological development has brought a new set of problems facing the individual.
 God forbid your utopia comes true. Look where we are.
