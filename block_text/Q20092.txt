Martin: Exactly. Exactly. Billy met Jean at the Staempfli show. Jean had a show at Staempfli Gallery [New York], of his Méta-matic drawing machines. Pontus came to New York in September of ’59. He didn’t really know anybody. I know he knew [Samuel L.] Sam Francis and so he met Sam Francis and Sam Francis was living in the same building and on the same floor as Alfred Leslie. Leslie was just finishing up making the film Pull My Daisy [1959]. So they all met each other. Billy talks about walking through Washington Square Park and seeing a poster for 18 Happenings in 6 Parts and saying, “What’s this ridiculous thing?” He and Pontus never went. But recently I found a list of people who had tickets to Kaprow’s piece and Pontus is on the list.
 Now whether he went or not, who knows? So it’s one of these strange things. Whether Billy met Bob at the Staempfli Gallery, whether Bob was at the opening—it’s highly likely—but who knows? I never asked Billy how he met Bob. I could shoot myself. Recently, I realized I never said, “When did you meet Bob?” I’m assuming that it was at this time. Somehow Bob knew Jean and, again, I wasn’t quite sure how.
 But recently, Melissa Rachleff Burtt, who is researching a show on artists-run galleries for NYU Grey [Art] Gallery and is looking at a series of interviews Billy and I did in 1990–91 for a projected book on art and artists, 1945–1965. [Note: Book never completed; several of the interviews will be published in Burtt’s forthcoming exhibition catalogue, Inventing Downtown: Artist-Run Galleries in New York City, 1952–1965, 2017.] She found an interview Billy and I made with Dore Ashton in 1990–91, where she said that Tinguely asked to meet Bob and that Dore took him to Bob’s studio. Dore was then a curator at MoMA and had arranged for Tinguely to make the self-destructive sculpture in the garden of MoMA. So Tinguely met Bob then, and Bob came to visit them when they were working in the garden and probably met Billy at this time.
