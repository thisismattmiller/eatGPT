For Variations VII John Cage wanted to “use sounds available at the time of the  performance.” 10 telephone lines were installed in the Armory by New York Telephone  Company. He had lines open in various places in New York City including Luchow's, the  Aviary, the 14th Street Con Edison electric power station, the ASPCA lost dog kennel,  The New York Times press room, and Merce Cunningham’s studio. Magnetic pickups  on the telephone receivers fed these sound sources into the sound manipulation system.  Cage also had 6 contact microphones on the performing platform itself and 12 contact  microphones on household appliances such as a blender, a juicer, a toaster, a fan, etc. He  also had 20 radio bands, 2 television bands, and 2 Geiger counters. Oscillators and pulse  generators completed the sound sources. Thirty photocells and lights were mounted at  ankle level around the performance area, which activated the different sound sources as  the performers moved around. Cage invited the audience to move around freely and many  stood near the performance area.
