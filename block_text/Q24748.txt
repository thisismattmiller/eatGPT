For the project Children and Communication, we linked one uptown and one downtown space in Manhattan with 14 dedicated telephone lines. The terminal equipment on these lines included facsimile machines, electro-writers, telex machines and telephones. Robert Whitman designed environments where the children could freely access all the equipment. For four months, in 1971 more than 500 children visited the two locations. They enthusiastically typed or hand-wrote messages, sent pictures and talked to children  at the other location, children from other areas of the city they would not normally meet.
