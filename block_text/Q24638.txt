To find works by American artists for the Art in Motion show, I began to visit artists’  studios, climbing staircases to the artists’ lofts, where many lived illegally, so you first  had to shout for them to drop down keys to the door.  
 To the left is Richard Stankeiwicz’s sculpture Apple. I had asked him if he needed any  technical help with the timing and relay switches, and he sent back a meticulously drawn  diagram of them. He knew exactly what he was doing.  
 The middle painting is Robert Rauschenberg’s Black Market. You were invited to move  the art yourself by writing your name on one of the four pads hanging on the painting,  taking one of the four objects from the suitcase attached to the painting and putting  another object in its place. Rauschenberg made the painting to the right in Stockholm. At  the gala opening, a lady pointed to the painting and shouted, “Ingemar Johansson [the  boxer] could have done that painting!” To her horror, Bob ran over to the painting and  wrote, “This is Johansson’s painting...” before she knocked his arm away. The writing is  still there.
