Martin: But any time Billy had any questions, he would always go to Bob. He absolutely trusted Bob’s take on things—his kind of decisions, his insight. He would go and say, “We’re thinking about doing this. What about it?” I mean, I can’t think specifically right now. But I know that there would be meetings where we were starting something. Billy would go and talk to Bob about it. Or if there was a question about something, he would go and talk to Bob about it. When we started the New York Collection for Stockholm project in 1971, Bob was very involved in it from the beginning. Pontus had chosen a beautiful cardboard piece for the collection and then Bob supported Billy’s idea to have Teledyne [Thousand Oaks, California] donate Mud Muse [1968–71] to the collection. The collection was originally a fundraising idea for E.A.T. that Bob Whitman discovered, in which the government used [U.S.] Treasury Funds to match donations to the government of property or other things of value. The collection was to go to an American museum and E.A.T. would get a grant through the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] Treasury Fund project. That didn’t work out and Pontus, having chosen the collection, asked that it go to Moderna Museet. Bob, Bob Whitman and the other artists agreed, as Pontus and Moderna Museet had been the first museum to show their generation of American artists in Europe. We had agreed to pay the artists what they would normally receive for their work and the dealers agreed to forego their commission so their commission would go to E.A.T. When it became clear that fundraising for getting the collection to Sweden was going to be difficult, we sat down with Bob and came up with the idea of each artist contributing a print to a portfolio that could be sold to raise money. Bob brought in Adi Rischner at Styria Studio [New York], whom he’d worked with on the Currents series [1970], to do the printing.
