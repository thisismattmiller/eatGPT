E.A.T. Local Groups began to spring up spontaneously as artists and engineers in areas  outside New York contacted us wanting to set up artist-engineer collaborations to work  with the new technology. We encouraged people to start Local Groups and gave them information and advice. By 1968 there were 28 E.A.T. Local Groups active in the U.S. and Canada, 4 in Europe and one in South America. In June 1968 we held an international conference at the loft in New York for E.A.T. representatives to meet and discuss ideas for organization and activities in their areas.  
 We also went on speaking tours to colleges and universities and visited Local Group  meetings. In this photograph, I am speaking to a group in Toronto. Behind me is a projection of the first technical requests from the artists for 9 EVENINGS.
