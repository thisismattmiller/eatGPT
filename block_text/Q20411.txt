Martin: Right. But, of course, a painting is always new every time you see it. Very few paintings you can remember to the point of saying, “Oh I’ve seen everything there is to see.” I mean, if you’re being serious about it. Maybe a monochrome, maybe the White Paintings [1951]. But the shadows change on them; the light in the room changes. They’re always different, you know?
 It reminds me of the first request Bob made to Billy, when they began to work together in the early sixties—how Bob understood how he could use the technology that Billy offered. Billy has written that Bob wanted to create a room that reacted to the person coming into it—the lights, sound, smell, shape, et cetera would react to the individual. A work that changed, responding to each individual. What Bob envisioned was beyond the technology of the day, but over the next years he explored—with his engineering collaborators—the possibilities that the technology could offer him.
