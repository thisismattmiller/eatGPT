In 1980 Trisha Brown asked Fujiko Nakaya to make a set for a new dance, Opal Loop. Fujiko designed a system for making a stage of fog for the dance, the volume and  movement of the fog were controlled by turning sets of nozzles off and on to create convection currents. The dance was first performed in an old DC power station on  Crosby Street in Manhattan. Later Trisha included Opal Loop in her program at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. We built a replica of the Brooklyn stage in my backyard  and tested the fog system before moving into the theater. Since the dancers could not dance on a wet marley floor, we rented a large gas-driven heat blower, used in football stadium dugouts, and put it underneath the stage to raise the temperature of the floor so the fog droplets evaporated immediately, keeping the floor dry. In this photo, Trisha  Brown, far left, and her dancers perform Opal Loop.
