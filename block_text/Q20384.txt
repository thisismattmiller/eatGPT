Martin: Right. Exactly. It was not collaboration but Billy was involved in Black Market, in the sense that Pontus had asked Billy to be the American agent to help organize the American contribution to a show he was organizing, Art in Motion [1961]. It went first to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and then to Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Billy helped Pontus visit some of the older artists who had been involved in movement—[Naum] Gabo gave Billy his 1920 sculpture [Kinetic Construction (Standing Wave), 1919–20] to restore for the show; [Alexander] Calder gave Pontus a model of The Four Elements [1961], which Pontus constructed in the courtyard in front of the museum, and they found Moholy-Nagy’s [Das] Lichtrequisit [Light Prop for an Electric Stage, 1930] in storage at the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard. 
 And then Billy asked some of the artists whom he was beginning to know in New York to be part of the exhibition. Richard Stankiewicz made a sculpture, The Apple [1961]. Jasper Johns lent an earlier work, Thermometer [1959]. And Bob made Black Market especially for the show. 
 I think he said that the art moves in and out of the piece. Visitors were supposed to take small objects from the suitcase attached to the painting, add something of their own and record it on the lists on clipboards attached to the surface of the painting. And as you said, people took objects and didn’t add anything of their own. I saw a telegram Pontus sent to Billy asking him to ask Bob to send more objects to Stockholm for the opening at Moderna Museet because people in Amsterdam had taken all the ones there. I don’t think Black Market fared too much better in Stockholm.
