This cross section of the Pavilion shows that visitors entered through a tunnel on the right, and descended into a dark clam-shaped room lit by moving patterns of laser light. Climbing the stairs, they came into the Mirror Dome, which was Bob Whitman’s idea. It was a 90-foot diameter 210-degree spherical mirror made of aluminized mylar in which the real image of the floor and the visitors on it hung upside down in space over the their heads. David Tudor designed the sound system as an “instrument” with 32 input channels and 37 speakers arranged in a rhombic grid on the surface of the dome behind the mirror. Sound could be moved at varying speeds around or across the dome, or it could be shifted abruptly from any one speaker to another, creating point sources of sound. Both the lighting system, designed by artist Tony Martin, and the sound system could be pre programed or controlled in real time from a console at one side of the Dome. The artists wanted to create a Pavilion where the vistors could explore the enviornment and create their own experience. The artists also conceived of the Pavilion as a  performance space, continuously programmed by visiting American and Japanese artists throughout the six months of Expo ‘70.
