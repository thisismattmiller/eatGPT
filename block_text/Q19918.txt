Martin: No, the first artists’ performance, which everyone calls Happenings. But Whitman, [Red] Grooms, [Jim] Dine, [Claes] Oldenburg always called their works some form of theater: Grooms, plays; Whitman, theater pieces; Dine, artists’ theater; Oldenburg called his series Ray Gun Theater [1962], et cetera. Again, this is one of my hobbyhorses: to rescue this work from the label Happenings.
 I knew conventional off-Broadway theater, somewhat—Theater de Lys, the Living Theater productions. I’d followed theater. I’d gone to a lot of theater productions at Harvard. One of the things about Harvard⎯maybe it’s still true⎯but in those days, the student productions were really good and really varied. Plus, in Boston there was some stuff going on that I went to.
