Martin: No, no. Christine Frohnert, who’s the wife of Thomas Buehler, who’s been a curator for Bob since the eighties—a physical curator, installing things [note: at the time of the interview Buehler was Collections Manager]—she and her business partner are conservators of technical works. They’ve just done a study, or are working on a study, of Homage to New York and they’ve followed the photos and the reports. But this is a very interesting thing to ask them. Are the engineers still alive? Harold Hodges is still alive.
