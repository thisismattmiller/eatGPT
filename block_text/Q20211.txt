Martin: Yes, it was really early. I know in one of the first newsletters I did, we list fifteen or twenty. We had a local groups conference in 1968 where we brought people who were interested in organizing E.A.T. groups together to give them the benefit of our wisdom [Laughter] We didn’t try to set up any kind of structure, which we could have. That could have been something else—to have had a national organization with chapters. Billy’s idea of an organization was a little bit based on IEEE, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, where you have a national organization and then you have local chapters that do kind of local things.
