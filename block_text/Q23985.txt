WHITE FOAM WAS A DISPOSABLE ENCLOSURE PRODUCED IN PHILADELPHIA TO HOUSE A MUSEUM OF MERCHANDISE SHOWN IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. A MOCK-UP ROOM, SERVING AS A FRAME-WORK, WAS MADE WITH CORRUGATED CARDBOARD. THE ROOM WAS THEN SPRAYED WITH LIQUID URETHANE FOAM WHICH ADHERED TO THE CARDBOARD, EXPANDED, AND THEREBY FORMED A SOLID HONEY-COMBED STRUCTURE. THE FINISHED WORK HOUSED THE MERCHANDISE SHOW FOR THREE WEEKS AND WAS DISPOSED OF AFTERWARDS.
