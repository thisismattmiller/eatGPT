Martin: So that’s where people you knew lived— [Laughter] —to be perfectly honest. You knew that they got the idea and they wanted to do something with it. We did try to encourage the groups. I remember going to Seattle and Portland [Oregon] and meeting with the people who wanted to have E.A.T. groups there and the woman in Berkeley [California]. Billy met with the people who were interested—like David MacDermott and Ardison Phillips already had a group of people they were working with and then they formed the E.A.T. L.A. group when we first started doing the pavilion because so much of the technology and industries were out there. David and Ardison and some young architects were very involved in aspects of the pavilion, in particular the air-structure mirror. But that chapter of E.A.T. remained very active for several years. E.A.T. Japan started when we started going to Japan for the pavilion, in January of ’69. It was quite active. Fujiko [Nakaya] did a great job administering it and doing it. At that moment, there was a real response to this concept of art and technology and artists and engineers and scientists working together.
