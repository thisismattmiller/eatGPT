FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
"Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineering," a dynamic fusion of music, painting, dance, film, television, and advanced technology, will be presented at the 25th Street Armory in New York City from October 13 to 23. A series of unique performances, the "Evenings" are the result of extraordinary cooperation between artists and scientists.
Over 30 engineers from Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., worked in their spare time to find solutions to performance problems posed by new concepts of the artists. They created mechanical and electronic equipment and developed chemical materials which permit totally new means of expression.
Billy Kluver of the Physical Optics and Electronics Research Department at Bell Laboratories supervised and coordinated the work of the engineers. The 9 participating artists are:
John Cage composer, writer
Lucinda Childs choreographer, dancer 
Oyvind Fahlstrom painter, playwright
Alex Hay painter, choreographer
Deborah Hay choreographer, dancer
Steve Paxton choreographer, dancer 
Robert Rauschenberg painter, choreographer
David Tudor musician 
Robert Whitman sculptor, film-maker
NOTE: Additional information will be included in a full press re ease scheduled for distribution in September, and an opportunity will be provided for members of the press to meet with some of the artists and scientists approximately one month prior to the first performance.
