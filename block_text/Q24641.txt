Alice Denney was running the Washington Gallery of Modern Art, and during a physics  convention in Washington, DC, I visited her and immediately drove her in my  convertible to Philadelphia where the Art 1963 show was still going on. She of course  picked up on the idea and together with Alan Solomon of the Jewish Museum organized  the Popular Image Exhibition which opened April 18, 1963.  
 Underneath the table in my laboratory I had an old reel-to-reel tape recorder which I  began lugging around to the artists in the exhibition and taped interviews with them. I cut  the tapes by hand on my dining room table and produced an LP record of the interviews  at Columbia Records. I later found out that these were the first taped interviews many of  these artists ever made. Andy made what was his first silkscreen for the record cover,  Giant Size 1.57. I helped him by laying out more than 100 record covers on the floor in  the fire house on East 47th street. First we sprayed them in different day-glo colors and  then silkscreened the text in black.
