Martin: But I give you your point. I see your point. I think you’re right. I mean the viewer extends the work. You’re back to Bob’s idea of extending the life of the work. If the work can change anytime someone sees it and it becomes different, then you’re really extending the life of it and making it new and fresh each time somebody else comes. That’s an aesthetic that you want. You want that aesthetic rather than a painting that just sits.
