Martin: Yes, with the cow. The next things I did see were in 1965, Spring Training at the First New York Theater Rally and Map Room II in December. He did Pelican again in Washington in 1966, for what Alice Denney called the NOW Festival. I was there for that and he did perform it at the First New York Theater Rally in spring 1965 with Alex Hay as the other man.
