In a sound-drenched Lower Manhattan loft building that was enlivened by revolving painted disks, film projections, floating pillows and miniskirted girls in paper smocks, representatives of industry and labor joined a number of artists and scientists yesterday to proclaim a "working alliance" between art and technology. This modest and uncertain gap between the two worlds. It is intended to bring modern technological tools to the artist for creating new art forms and fresh insights and viewpoints to the engineer for creating a "people-oriented" technology. The event was celebrated at news conference "happening" in the six-story loft building at 381 Lafayette Street used for studio poses by Robert Rauschenberg, the avant-garde artist.
