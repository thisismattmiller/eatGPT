At the 47th Street Factory, Andy Warhol asked me for a floating light bulb. We made  some calculations and discovered it was not possible with existing battery technology.  While working on the idea, my colleague at Bell Laboratories found a material called  Scotchpak™ which was relatively impermeable to helium and could be heat sealed. It  
 was used by the United States Army for wrapping sandwiches. When I brought this  material to Andy he decided to make clouds and while we were figuring out how to heat seal curves, he simply folded the material over and made these Silver Clouds, which were  first shown at Leo Castelli’s gallery in 1966. The sculptures had a wonderful buoyancy  as they hovered gently in the room. The heat gradient between the floor and ceiling  creates a slight pressure differential; we could balance the Silver Clouds using paperclips  to make them float between ceiling and floor.
