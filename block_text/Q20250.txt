Martin: I don’t think so. We didn’t find support for individual artist’s and engineer’s projects. In the beginning, in the early issues of the newsletter, there was emphasis on industrial support of these collaborations and the need for industry to be part of the picture. We did try to do some of this—in particular, set up possibilities for artists to work within industries—the Singer Corporation and a residency agreement with the Amalgamated Lithographers Union to have artists working their experimental workshop. But I think the artists’ projects and requests were too varied for E.A.T. to be able to go to the appropriate industry for each of them. It evolved for the individual engineer to work with the artist and possibly be the carrier of the project to his business.
 The model of directly placing artists within certain industries was carried out by Maurice Tuchman at LACMA [Los Angeles County Museum of Art], in his Art and Technology exhibition project. He chose well-known artists and matched them up with participating industries in the L.A. area and hoped for a work to emerge that he could show. There’s a great catalogue that follows each artist-industry project and you can see some successes that resulted in beautiful works. Rauschenberg’s Mud Muse at Teledyne came out of this program. But his goal was only to produce works for an exhibition and once the exhibition was over in 1971, there was no follow-up.

 Maybe E.A.T.’s not raising money for individual artworks comes from the idea that we were not in the art-making business. We were in the social revolution business. Of course, before E.A.T. started, Billy worked with individual artists.
