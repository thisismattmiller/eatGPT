Martin: No, there was no idea of paying for this service. It might have been a good idea from a fundraising point of view but Billy and Bob wanted E.A.T. to be open and reach as many artists as possible. You didn’t want to have the artist pay for something. But there’s something really funny in an early newsletter. In one of them Billy wrote, “If you want to join, please fill out the artist membership form. Names written on little slips of paper aren’t useful.” [Laughter] The idea was that people became members. They would sign up and the artists would become members. Engineers would sign up and become members as well. The engineers were encouraged to become members and on their membership form to give information on their technical field and their interest in working with artists. Then any member could, of course, ask any question they wanted. The effort in the beginning was to attract engineers. That the artists were interested was shown at the first E.A.T. meeting that they held on November 30th where they had a panel of artists and engineers who’d worked on 9 Evenings. They had made a general invitation to the art world and something like three hundred people showed up. You’ve probably seen that photo.
