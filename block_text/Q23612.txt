THIS IS MY RESIGNATION AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD. I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS SOMETIME AGO. IT IS CLEAR TO ME AND ONLY FAIR TO YOU AND THE STAFF THAT WHAT IS NEEDED FOR THIS JOB IS SOMEONE WHO CAN WORK DIRECTLY IN COUNCILING AND PLANNING. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE FOR SOME TIME TO GIVE YOU OR E.A.T. THE ASSISTANCE IT REQUIRES, AND FROM NOW ON IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE EVEN LESS I AM [WILL WORK AS] WORKING IN TAMPA THRU THE SPRING, EXHIBITING AND GOING TO PARIS IN SUMMER AND AFRICA FOLLOWING. CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD CANNOT BE SOMEONE WHO IS LIVING SOMEWHERE ELSE DOING OTHER THINGS. I WILL CONTINUE MY INTEREST IN YOUR PROJECTS AND CAN BE LESS COMPLICATED ABOUT BEING YOUR FRIEND. 
 MY LOVE TO YOU ALL
 [BOB]
