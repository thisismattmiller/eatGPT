By 1965, interest among the artists in using technology had grown, and many of the  artists who had performed together at Judson Church and other spaces in New York  expressed a desire to stage large-scale performances. Bob Rauschenberg and I organized  a group of artists to work together with engineers on a series of performances involving  new technology. The group included John Cage, Lucinda Childs, Öyvind Fahlström,  Alex Hay, Deborah Hay, Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Robert Rauschenberg, David  Tudor, and Robert Whitman. The first planning meeting of artists and engineers took  place in early 1966 in Rauschenberg’s studio. During the summer of 1966, more than 30  engineers, most of them from Bell Laboratories, worked in one-to-one collaboration with  individual artists, depending on the artist’s project and engineer’s speciality. Other  engineers worked on equipment and systems that could be used by all the artists.
