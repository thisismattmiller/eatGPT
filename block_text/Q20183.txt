Martin: We got a grant from the New York State Council on the Arts [NYSCA]. It was one of the first grants. John [B.] Hightower, who was Executive Director of NYSCA—who just died recently—was a fan. In those days, apparently it was really easy to apply for grants because we got one. We also got a grant from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
