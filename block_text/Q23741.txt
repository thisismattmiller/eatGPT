The Festival of Theater and Engineering will present a series of dance, music and theater performances which are a result of the use of the inventive skills and the craft of the engineer as material by the artist. Although the artists relation to the engineer is obviously more complicated, the engineer and his capacity can be said to fill a function similar to that of the oilpaint for the traiditional painter, or the stone for the sculptor.
