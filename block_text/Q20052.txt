Martin: Not that I know of. One of the things I think about—well, there was one phosphor that they used in Steve Paxton’s piece in 9 Evenings that an engineer wrote up later in a technical journal. It would change color with heat on the skin. It could be used to detect the path of laser beams operating above the visible spectrum. Certainly this development of FM transmitters.
 Billy and his colleagues at Bell Labs first started it with Yvonne Rainer, when they built this little FM transmitter that transmitted the sound of her breathing as she danced.
