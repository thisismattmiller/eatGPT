Q: Another way to narrate it would be to say that it originates in Black Mountain and that kind of cross-media collaboration that is so prevalent in that space in the fifties. And even more specifically, you could argue that it comes out of a Cage-Cunningham aesthetic. I wondered whether either of thoseâ€”whether you would say that this kind of cross-fertilization originates with the Black Mountain scene or originates specifically with the Merce Cunningham [Dance] Company? And that you have Cage and Cunningham working so closely together and then people like Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, coming through and working with the company. And then some of those people spiral off but keep collaborating.
