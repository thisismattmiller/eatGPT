Martin: No. But I do think Billy never thought that he was an artist. He never did. He said it was always a danger if the accountant or the engineer thought he was the artist. The collaboration wouldn’t work if people didn’t recognize what’s an aesthetic decision and respect it and respect the artist and trust the artist. I think he was quite extraordinary and unique in that way.
