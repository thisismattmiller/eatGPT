Martin: No. I don’t know if I saw it at Leo [Castelli]’s or not. It’s possible because at that point, Robert and I would be following things and Castelli was one of the people you followed. But I can’t say that I had.
 Oh, I know! ’65, the First New York Theater Rally. So I saw Spring Training and Pelican because Robert and I were going to all of those performances, primarily because of Whitman. I wasn’t working with Whitman yet but Robert and I went to all his performances. That was the spring of ’65. May, I think.
