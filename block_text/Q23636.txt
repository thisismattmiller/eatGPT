Rauschenberg's 'Oracle' Another sculptural construction was a sound-emitting assembly consisting of a tire, truck door, window frame, bathtub and air vent. This is Mr. Rauschenberg's "Oracle." Five radios are used, with the tuning dial of each being rotated by motor. Thus, each radio picks up snatches of the broadcasts of all the local radio stations. To eliminate wiring from assembly components to the central pick-up point, signals from the radios are relayed to the components by small FM transmitters. Last year an artist-engineer collaboration called "Nine Evenings: Theater and Engineering" left the art critics bewildered. A few visitors at the Lafayette Street show also looked with puzzlement on "Oracle." But the show sponsors emphasized that it was the idea of collaboration, and not a specific art work, that counts most.
