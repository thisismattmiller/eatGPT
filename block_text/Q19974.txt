Martin: Very straightforward, very direct. Once he had a piece going, [he was] very clear about what he wanted. But, very much, you had the responsibility for doing it. Whitman always flirted with disaster. He was always pushing himself further. If something went wrong, it was like he accepted it. Not happy about it but—and I think Bob [Rauschenberg] was the same way, about always pushing oneself, having new ideas, never repeating.
 Okay. Happenings. They weren’t Happenings. I have to talk—this is another hobbyhorse. But the point is, it started with a group of young artists being interested in doing performance. Whitman, actually, had gone to Columbia to be a playwright. I mean, he’d been in Rutgers [University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] to be a playwright. Then he took a year at Columbia, which he dropped out of. His interest was really in a kind of theater. Then he got, through the people he knew at Rutgers, like Lucas Samaras, a fellow student, and [Allan] Kaprow, who was his professor for some courses. He started making art or became as interested in making art. Through Kaprow he was in one of the last Hansa Gallery shows in New York in January of 1959. Also, he was in New Media—New Forms at the Martha Jackson Gallery [New York] in June 1960. [Note: The exhibition is also referred to as New Forms—New Media.] There were two influential Martha Jackson shows in 1960 and 1961. He was in at least one of them. Kaprow of course had published his now famous article on “The Legacy of Jackson Pollock” [1958], and how from Pollock’s overall paintings, art was moving off the canvas into what were called “environments” in those days—probably called installations today—and he talked about performances.
