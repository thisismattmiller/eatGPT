Solo is a white, even, clear event in space.The perform­ ers are part of the space and light. They continue the quality of the area - a white environment. All movement is with the intention of main­taining a balance of order and evenness.
S010 is cumulative, gradu­ally accumulating more light, more platforms, more per­formers, more activity -yet remaining as still and com­posed as in the beginning.
There are 24 performers. Eight of the performers re­main stationary. Formally dressed, they are seated as a musical ensemble. From this position they operate eight remote control plat­ forms, which move in and around the space. Sixteen of the performers also move in and around the space, sometimes on the platforms.
Bright lights around the stage area are strongly re­flected by the white cos­tumes of the 16 moving per­formers. The extreme intensity or light bouncing off the costumes modifies the lines of the human body. At times there are no lights. I am interested in creating a middle ground between see­ing and not seeing.
The principal visual ele­ments of the piece are mov­ing performers, lights, dark­ness, remote control plat­ forms, and movement. It is my main intention to make all these elements equal in energy and visibility.
