Martin: They would become a member for maybe a thousand dollars a year. I think we tried that. We also tried to have a membership campaign for individuals and the only person who responded and became a member was Dr. Frank Stanton from CBS. I remember that Billy did fundraising to specifically raise the money to pay the prize for the engineers in the E.A.T. competition. The Brooklyn show was put together with a lot of volunteer work from the artists and engineers involved. I think just at the time when things were getting rough, during the time of the Brooklyn show, the Pepsi project came along and they gave us some money to develop a proposal. Then the next two years were funded a lot by working on the Pepsi Pavilion. But we were doing a lot of other projects and activities besides.
