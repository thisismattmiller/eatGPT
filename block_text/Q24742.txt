This photograph of Ritty Burchfield with a flag is the first formal photograph taken in the mirror and was used for publicity in Japan. Remy Charlip used this flag and other large  pieces of colored cloth for a performance in the Mirror on opening day of the Pavilion. The space in the mirror was gentle and poetic, rich and always changing. It was quite  complex in spite of its simplicity. Every day we discovered new and complicated optical effects.
