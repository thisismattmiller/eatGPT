My project is simple to describe. It is a piece of music, Variation VII, indeter­minate in form and detail, making use of the sound sys­tem which has been devised collectively for this festival, further making use of modu­lation means organized by David Tudor, using as sound sources only those sounds which are in the air at the moment of performance, picked up via the communi­cation bands, telephone lines, microphones, together with, instead of musical in­struments, a variety of household appliances and frequency generators.
The technical problems involved in any single project tend to reduce the impact of the original idea, but in being solved they produce a situation different than anyone could have pre-imagined.
