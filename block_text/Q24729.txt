With the help of Theodore Kheel, we organized a press conference at Bob  Rauschenbergâ€™s building on October 10, 1967, to formally launch E.A.T. It was  accompanied by a one-day exhibition of works of art incorporating technology.  Representatives from industry, labor, government, and the academic and technical  communities, including John Pierce of Bell Laboratories, and Senator Jacob Javits, expressed support for E.A.T. at the press conference. Press coverage exceeded our expectations, including this above-the-fold article in The New York Times.
