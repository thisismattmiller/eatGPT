In 1961, I arranged to have Hans Nordenström’s short to-the-point comic strips published  in The Village Voice. When this one appeared, I got a call from Audrey Sabol from  Philadelphia, who wanted to buy the original for her son who was weight lifter. We met  at the bar at the Carlyle Hotel in New York. I found out that Audrey, Joan Kron, and  Acey Wolgin were planning to mount an exhibition of American painting at the  YM/YWHA in Philadelphia. I convinced them to make an exhibition of the new  generation of artists and I helped them select the show from my artist friends in New  York. They called the exhibition Art 1963: A New Vocabulary, which has since led to  some confusion, since it opened October 25, 1962. It was beaten by a month from being  the first pop art exhibition in America, although it was the first on the East Coast.  It was Audrey’s and Joan’s idea to make the catalogue as a set of galley proofs with  handwritten corrections, held together with a clothespin. Because the art would be so new  to Philadelphia, they made the catalogue into a dictionary, with quotes from the artists  and definitions of words that were common in the art world. One morning within 20  minutes I produced definitions of words I believed relevant: for example, “look v. the  thing to do.” Allan Kaprow wrote the art historical definitions. I thought it would be a  neat idea for my definitions to be signed BK and his be signed AK. But when Allan saw  what I had written, he thought they were not serious enough and refused to sign his  contributions to the dictionary.
