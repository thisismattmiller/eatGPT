Martin: Again, I’m not an art historian so I can’t—I mean, people who built things like Gabo, the early Gabo. Who knows? He could have done it himself. Calder himself was an engineer. Gabo did it and [inaudible]. It’s also a Bauhaus idea. The Bauhaus people who came over and ended up in Chicago with the New Bauhaus, and then architecture. So some of these ideas of the melding of disciplines came from this Bauhaus influence. But it’s funny. There was a resistance to this melding of mediums. If you talk to Alfred Leslie, I remember he was a painter and then in 1959 he made a film, Pull My Daisy, and then The Last Clean Shirt [1964]. And he remembers that there was a lot of criticism: you can’t be a filmmaker and an artist, you can’t do this. This was like ’59. Early on, there were these—you are separate. You’re a filmmaker or you’re an artist or you’re a dancer. So something shifted and I don’t know if there were engineers. But I think specifically some of Billy’s ideas—it probably was the first time someone thought about the idea of using non-art technology in art. I mean, art has its own technology—paint chemistry, sculpture, mold making, bronze casting, printmaking, the whole thing. There’s a huge amount of technology in art itself. But this idea of technology that comes from outside art and is incorporated into it, I think this probably was a new idea. And certainly people responded to it. I mean, it got responded to quite extraordinarily.
