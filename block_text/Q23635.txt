Kheel's 'Biggest Mediation' Mr. Rauschenberg, along with Dr. Billy Kl√ºver, an electronics engineer who is specializing in laser research at the Bell Laboratories, and Theodore W. Kheel, the lawyer-labor mediator, are prime movers in the art-technology merger. "For me," said Mr. Kheel, "this is the biggest mediation I've ever undertaken." Among the art objects on display was a large drawing of a nude generated by a computer. Masterminded by two engineers, L. D. Harmon and K. C. Knowlton, this project involved the making of a transparency from a photograph and scanning it with a device operating like a television camera. The information on the transparency was then stored on magnetic tape in the form of pulses standing for digits, with the brightness level of the picture elements represented by numbers ranging from 0 to 7. After processing all the numbers, the computer printed a drawing of micropatterns formed by clusters of symbols used in electronic design. Visitors at the studios were intrigued by a sculptural representation of a woman a shower. As droplets of from water dripped the shower-head in a white stall, moving-picture images of the woman were registered by a projector behind the stall on a sand-blasted Plexiglass panel.
