Martin: I went to this show. I had finished my thesis at Columbia in the fall of 1965 and thus had graduated there that semester. I was just hanging around doing nothing, or looking for a job.
 Whitman repeated Prune Flat at the Martinique Theatre, a theater in the Martinique Hotel near Thirty-fourth Street in the spring and then Paul Libin, the owner of Circle in the Square Theatre, offered Whitman the theater for the whole summer of 1966. Whitman put on two pieces every weekend, two days a weekend, Friday and Saturday: Prune Flat and a piece called Untitled.
 I was what would pass for a stage manager or assistant. I ran the projectors for Prune Flat, which meant I had to block off—rather than project—sections of the back film. So the film going on the girl would be clear and wouldn’t get mixed up with the film going on the back. That was my job. Also I swept up the broken glass from the broken light bulb to clear the stage for the second piece. For the piece, Untitled, Steve Paxton was in it and he wore a white suit. The last image was different puffs of colored smoke coming out of different parts of the suit. Bob had tubes running from backstage to different holes cut in the suit jacket. My job was to pack the tubes in the suit with colored powder. I would put a bit of Kleenex in the tube to hold the powder at the end, push it down the tube a little and then pour the powder into the end of the tube. You can’t imagine how much white shoe polish I used on the suit when I would spill the powder trying to get it into the tube. Also I had to clean it every week.
