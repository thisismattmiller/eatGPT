The idea of the one-to-one collaboration between individual artists and engineers or scientists was the basis of E.A.T. These collaborations made it possible for artists to  pursue ideas that required the use of new technology, and the work could develop in directions that neither the artist or the engineer could have foreseen. We also believed that these collaborations could lead technology in directions more positive for the needs, desires, and pleasures of the individual. We developed the Technical Services Program, whose principal activity was to match artists who had technical problems or projects with  engineers or scientists who could work with them. Over the years E.A.T. has helped  thousands of artists who approached us for technical assistance. In 1967 Fred Waldhauer and L.J. Robinson collaborated with Rauschenberg on his large interactive sculpture Soundings. In this photograph Robinson, center, talks with Rauschenberg, to the right, during the installation of Soundings at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.
