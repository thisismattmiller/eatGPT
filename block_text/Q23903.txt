NINE EVENINGS: THEATER AND ENGINEERING Remarks by Oyvind Fahlstrom September 29, 1966 In my piece, "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine," I approach the new technology on several levels. Chemicals developed by the new technology permit me to use elements formerly not possible--an object gradually changing color, "snow bubbles" rising from the ground, people enveloped by "clouds." By utilizing our internal broadcasting system, I can have pillows sing out while they are bounced on the floor or thrown in the air. By utilizing our remote control system,I can have an actor pursued by an air- borne object or direct the same object to approach floating targets. On another level, my piece deals with machine-1ike qualities in people: robot-like people capable of memorizing enormous amounts of data or of making multi- digit calculations in their heads (as found in psychiatric literature); the risk of putting "robots" (narrow minds) in situations for which they are not "programmed"-- i.e., crisis situations--and machines getting out of control. Juxtaposed with this are glimpses of everyday events and characters of the world of today. Bob Hope and Mao Tse Tung appear in New York City street demonstrations, for example. For this we will use films of an actual demonstration along with tapes of the reactions of the people who see it. Tape and film become a part of the piece. New York, China, Indonesia, the bottom of the sea, space, the world of the future (as seen in a science fiction movie)--all are interwoven into a triptych of slide, movie, and television screens. There is no explanation. The spectator draws conclusions or not, as he chooses. I think of it as initiation rites for a new medium, Total Theater.
