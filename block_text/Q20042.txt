Q: Can I read you a quote? This is the Japanese 2003 catalogue on E.A.T. [E.A.T.—The Story of Experiments in Art and Technology]. Billy has this prefatory essay and what you just said reminds me of—I think this is what you mean. Maybe this is what you’re thinking of. This is Billy: “At the time, I was doing a lot of thinking about the development of the new technology and our ability to affect it in ways more positive for the individual. In an article I wrote in 1959, ‘Fragment on Man and the System,’ I argued that individual engineers and scientists have total responsibility for the technology he or she is creating in the direction technology takes.
 Engineers and scientists have to be aware that technology is not on one unchangeable path. Its direction can be constantly changed and it can go in all directions. But the engineer or scientist goes through years of formal training in the language and practice of science. He can make a discovery or break through that and expand scientific knowledge but his contribution still remains within a mutually agreed scientific system. Art, on the other hand, is outside any such system. An artist’s ideas are capable of transcending or radically expanding the boundaries of Western thought. For me, the act of [Marcel] Duchamp choosing the snow shovel is the best example of one person’s ability to shatter classic boundaries in art and thinking.” That sounds like that’s almost what you were talking about.
