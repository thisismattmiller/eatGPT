Martin: Too idealistic. Maybe, ultimately, impossible. But also the structures were more rigid in those daysâ€”manufacturing structures. One of the things we found when approaching industry to have an artist-in-residence in an industry or carry out a large project, for example, was that the head of the company was very enthusiastic about the idea, but the resistance came from middle management, the people involved in day-to-day operations. The presence of the artist would disrupt the structure he or she had established. Industries were very hierarchical and the idea of collaboration between workers or between departments was not in the air, so to speak. These ideas have only gained traction in recent years. It works individually. It works on individuals. One person at a time.
