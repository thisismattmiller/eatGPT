Martin: Right. And in the early days of E.A.T., it was still pretty informal grant-giving. I remember we got a grant from the JDR [John D. Rockefeller] 3rd Fund to send artists to India. I think Billy called Porter [A.] McCray or met with him and said that, up to now, they had invited Asian artists to come to New York and Billy suggested sending American artists to India. There was informality, even with the New York State Council. We didn’t get involved in funding artist projects. Maybe if there had been a huge demand for it that might have been something E.A.T. could have done. There was no sense about fiscal sponsors even. You know? So those concepts weren’t there—those fundraising concepts. We did try to do some artists-in-residence, and with some success. We sort of never did anything twice—like a yearly exhibition of art and technology, or continuing courses on technology for artists—which doesn’t help in terms of longevity.
