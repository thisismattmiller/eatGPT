About 370 artists already have written to Dr. Klüver and Mr. Rauschenberg seeking technical assistance for projects they have in mind. The letters include requests for information on synthetic fabrics, pigments, enamel finishes, translucent spheres, micro-organisms, electromagnetics, “slow chemical destruction of objects,” “extending the range of sensory perception” and an “efficient way” to make paintings appear and disappear.
