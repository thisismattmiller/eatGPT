Martin: I guess E.A.T. didn’t want to institutionalize it, but it wanted to broaden the reach of this idea. Maybe the more engineers you reach on an individual level, then the more impact it will have on society. So that is what Billy was feeling in the mid-1960s. If he was the only engineer doing this, it’s not going to go very far. It made some incredible works of art but in terms of social impact, it’s not going to go that far.
