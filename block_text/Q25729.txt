 Dear Mr. Kluver ,
 With the close of the exhibition , Rauschenberg / Performance , Contemporary Arts Museum , I would like to thank you for the kind loan of the tennis racket used in the performance , Open Score . 
 The show was very well received here in Houston ; over 11,322 Museum visitors viewed the exhibition during its installation here . I have enclosed copies of the local press for your files , as well as the small catalogue we published to accompany the exhibition .
 Thank you again for the loan ; its inclusion in the show helped insure a comprehensive presentation .
 Very truly yours ,
 Marti Mayo
 Curator
