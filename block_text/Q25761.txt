I am extremely surprised with the negative attitude Patricia Johnson takes in her review of the Rauschenberg / Performance exhibition at the Contemporary Arts Museum ( Zest , May 20 ) . Her premise , it seems , is that this documentation of performances that took place 20 and 30 years ago is " ridiculous and static . " The documentary recording of performance art has established precedent , for good reason , not only at CAM but also the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and major museums across the country . It allows us to evaluate , years later , the artistic merit of the performances and to remember a past era . The Rauschenberg performances are a part of the history of modern American art , and the Contemporary Art Museum is to be praised for a thoughtfully curated exhibition that helps us understand performance art then and now .
