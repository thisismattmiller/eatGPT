Q: The way he narrates it in the pieces Iâ€™ve seen is that Rauschenberg was in the habit of dropping in to see how their work on the Homage to New York, which they were building in the in the garden of MoMA, [was progressing]. My impression from the way he wrote it was that Rauschenberg knew Tinguely and so came by to see their work on this thing and then met the guy who was the engineer who was helping him.
