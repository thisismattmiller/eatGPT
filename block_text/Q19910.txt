Martin: I was not in the art world at all. I mean, I went to see art. Mainly, I was going to see art. In Boston, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, or the Fogg and Busch-Reisinger museums at Harvard. And like many of my fellow Radcliffe students, I audited Fine Arts 101 but I’m afraid it took place after lunch and I often dozed off in the middle of the Renaissance. Also my parents had been members of the Museum of Modern Art [MoMA, New York] and got many of the catalogues, which were distributed to members in those days, and I remember my parents and I went to see the Pollock exhibition when it took up the whole museum, and in ’57 we saw the Pollock show there. I saw art but I was not in the art world. Sort of never have been, actually, come to think about it.
