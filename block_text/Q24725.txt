9 Evenings generated a great interest in using new technology among the artists in New York. Robert Whitman, Fred Waldhauer, Robert Rauschenberg, and I decided to form  Experiments in Art and Technology as a not-for-profit service organization for artists, engineers, scientists and industry, to promote artistsâ€™ access to the new technology they wanted for their work. On November 30, 1966, we called a meeting at the Central Plaza Hotel on lower Broadway in New York to determine the amount of interest the artists had in this idea. Three hundred artists came to the meeting, and we collected eighty immediate requests for technical help. We realized that our first task was to interest more engineers in working with artists.
