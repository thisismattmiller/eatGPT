Martin: Yes, I mean, I can but I’m not sure. I’m trying to think, whether—[pauses] after ’74, Billy would see Bob. We’d go to openings. We would go to parties. If Billy had something, he would talk to Bob. I can’t think of specific—I mean, I can think of some things that Billy was doing, or impressions of Bob. I can’t see beyond this impression of somebody who was extraordinarily smart and just so right on about things. Right on about not letting you get away with any kind of bullshit. A kind of incredibly moral sense of decisions, you know? And calling people on it. Calling you on—keeping you straight somehow. You’d always be kind of surprised. He’d say something—you’d be kind of surprised, you know? It would make you think. This ability to make you think.
 I worked with him on one thing, a set of proposals for cultural activities. It’s in Techne where we published what he had written—his ideas about what to do for cultural activities in New York.
 He came up with these wonderful suggestions. I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but I can show it to you. What could be done with people—with cultural activities in New York neighborhoods. He said, “You can’t bring culture to people. You can only bring it out of them.” I mean, in the sense of their own culture. That was an amazing experience to work with him on compiling ideas and suggestions.
