 When you're workingwith something that's as physical as radio equipment, what's absurdto dois very quickly determined. The machine[?] has no tolerance for getting outside a particular radio wave or whatever it is you're working with. The kind of equipment we're inviting has it's own integrity built into it. where as an artist has to [??????] fake or somehow manage to assume integrity or not. But it's much more complicated for an artist to deal with qualities like honesty [???] integrity and fact. 
 
 Isn't there a kind of intimidation going on; 1ike: technology, even if it isn't functioning, is perfect?
 
 I am notinterested doing this thing with a bunch of technical[?] stuff dolling it up it has to be a collaboration rather than an exploitation.
