Martin: Okay. Well then you’re in the social context of art, right? You know, the thing about an aesthetic decision—we’re talking about decisions in the making of the work of art. I think that’s the difference. If the artist wants to make it possible for the individual to keep going and do something that changes the work in some way, that’s his decision to do it. I just mean that when you’re making it, if the engineer would say, “Well, how about a light here? It’s a little dark up there, Bob.” Or, “I have a great-looking chair at home that could fit in this piece.” That’s an aesthetic suggestion that he shouldn’t be making. Do you know what I mean?
