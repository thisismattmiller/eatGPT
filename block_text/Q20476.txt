Q: Well, I wanted to talk more specifically about Bob Rauschenberg and some general memories of his personality and then to go through some of the stuff we were talking about over email about the later projects. But if you could just give us—it doesn’t have to be specific anecdotes—but your sense of him as a person. So here’s someone—imagine you’re describing him to me. I never met Bob Rauschenberg. What was he like? What was it like to be in the room with him? What was his personality like?
