My group at Bell Laboratories had put up the first communication satellite, called ECHO: an aluminum-coated mylar balloon about a hundred feet in diameter. But nobody had ever looked inside a mirror of this size. Elsa Garmire calculated the properties of such a mirror and to test these optical effects and demonstrate them to skeptical Pepsi executives, we decided to build a full- scale model of the mirror. E.A.T.-Los Angeles, under the direction of David McDermott and Ardison Phillips, had been investigating air structures and organized the installation of the 90-foot diameter mirror in a former dirigible hangar at the Marine Air Corps Station at Santa Ana, just south of Los Angeles.  The mirror ripped as they were inflating it, but Ardison simply put it back in its box and sent it to Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, where it was repaired and successfully installed a few weeks later. The effects were spectacular, and we held a press conference and great party for the artists and Pepsi executives. Because of its experience in building the ECHO and PAGEOS satellites and its ability to hold the optical tolerances we needed, the final mirror was manufactured by G.T. Schjeldahl of Northfield, Minnesota.
