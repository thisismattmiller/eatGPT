Jasper Johns asked me for a transparent gas-discharge letter to include in a painting. He  wanted the power supply to be mounted behind the painting without any power cords  attaching the painting to the wall. My colleagues and I designed a battery-driven high voltage power supply. A multi-vibrator circuit converted the DC voltage from 12-volt  rechargeable batteries into AC voltage, which was transformed into 700 volts to power  the neon letter. Here I am standing with the red neon ’R’ in Johns’ Field Painting, of  1963-64.
