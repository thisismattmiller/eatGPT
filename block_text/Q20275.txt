Martin: You’re part of the process in maybe suggesting. Well, let’s say for Solstice [1968]. Bob told [L. J.] Robby Robinson he wanted to do a piece for Documenta [4] and he wanted it to be interactive but obvious to the viewer how it worked. Robby said he thought of doors opening and closing in the Amsterdam airport and suggested sliding doors. Bob came back to him and had the plan for Solstice with five sliding doors the viewers could walk through, opening and closing behind them. Then it was up to Robby to find the sliding doors. He found pneumatic, air- powered doors and I think it was he who decided to use that system. It was a technical decision but I’m sure he ran it by Bob, “We have these air-powered doors.” It’s being involved—you’re contributing your expertise. And both of them are valuable. You’re not saying the artist is more valuable, necessarily. He is in the sense that it’s his artwork and that he signs it. Okay. But it’s the structure, the social structure. In the collaboration, each is necessary. You couldn’t have the artwork without the engineering.
