Martin: No, I don’t think so. There was a conscious decision not to have an E.A.T. laboratory because Billy and Fred thought it could not serve the variety of artists’ needs and it would become outdated very quickly. So the emphasis was on recruiting engineers working in industry and industrial laboratories to work with artists. Thus the artists would be in touch with people working with up-to-date technology in their field. The equipment that was at the E.A.T. loft was the equipment developed for 9 Evenings that was made available to any artist who wanted to use it. Ralph Flynn was soon hired to be in charge of the equipment and to help with artists’ requests. I did an interview with him recently so there might be some information there.
