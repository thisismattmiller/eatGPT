RAUSCHENBERG Performance at the Contemporary Arts Museum is not only visually disappointing, it presents objects that were intended to be alive in performance in a ridiculous , static state .
 Twenty and 30 years ago , modern dance riveted critics and angered audiences . Avant - garde composers like John Cage were making disjointed and dissonant music , and dancers and choreographers like Merce Cunningham were breaking the rules of classical dance . Pop artists glorified the most commonplace objects, epitomized by Andy Warhol's Campbell Soup Can , and the young generation reveled in the newness of it all.
 Rauschenberg assimilated all the arts . In 1954 he began his life - time involve ment with performance . He designed sets , costumes and props for dance companies like Cunningham's and on occasion also choreographed and danced for them to music by Cage . Like his combines of the same period which stunried the art world , the performance material was perceived as audacious , even shocking .
 But as these costumes and props hang on walls and sit on the floor today , they are neither interesting nor do they possess sensual or thoughtful appeal. One can only remember that these things on display in the museum's lower gallery are out of place and context , for their life depends on the life given them by movement and sound.
