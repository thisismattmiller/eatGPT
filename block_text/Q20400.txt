Martin: No, it’s a beautiful piece to experience—to see the lights changing and the images of the chairs tumbling through space—but interacting with it over a long period of time is not easy. Some people have played their violin to it or sung to it. Maybe you’re creating that work of art. It’s true. You’re creating a specific experience, anyway. The art is there to give you an experience. You are creating the experience. It’s also Bob’s idea of collaboration. He invites the viewer to collaborate with him on creating the experience of the work. So not only does he collaborate with his materials and with the people working with him, he collaborates with his future viewers. But at the same time he gives them the responsibility for completing the piece. It’s up to the individual how much he or she wants to commit to working with the piece.
 I think you do have a really interesting point, but I think the answer is that the artist has already conditioned the limits of what decisions you, the viewer, can make. You can talk or not talk. If you come into the space and silently stand on your head, then you will see yourself in the mirror, but you won’t activate the lights. Maybe I’m being pedantic, I don’t know. You can walk into it, or you cannot walk into it. You can’t switch the doors around. You can’t have it not work.
