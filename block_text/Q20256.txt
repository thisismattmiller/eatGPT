Martin: Yes, I think Billy was very sensitive to this. To Per Biorn, it didn’t seem to make any difference. We’re just scanning the stations. But to Bob, somehow, he knew the noise between stations was something he wanted—something he liked. It was an aesthetic decision as opposed to a purely technical one. When Billy was working with artists, he would try not to take anything for granted in that sense. He would understand that this is something the artist could decide or should decide. Even if they didn’t care, he asked them. I know there was a situation when we were working on the pavilion, where the engineer interfered with aesthetic decisions. David Tudor was working with an engineer called Larry Owens, who really didn’t understand him.
 David always wanted more possibilities, more channels. I mean, the more you could get, the better. They were designing and building the sound modulation system for the sound in the pavilion. There were thirty-seven speakers arranged across the roof of the dome and David wanted as many sound input channels as he could get. But Larry said, “You don’t need more than eight channel inputs.” So here was an engineer making an aesthetic decision, which to him was just an engineering decision. As I say, Billy didn’t know about it. He wasn’t aware of this. Billy always felt bad about this—that David didn’t get as many channels as he would have liked.
