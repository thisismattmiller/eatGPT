Q: That’s one thing I was wondering. That was also in the book about the Pompidou Center in Paris. I was just looking at that and it was reminding me that E.A.T. was asked to design this screen that was going to go on the outside of the Pompidou Center. It made me wonder—the Pepsi Pavilion too—whether E.A.T. was not just a kind of clearinghouse, putting X in contact with Y—artists and engineers in touch—but was actually an organization looking for work. That makes it sound like E.A.T. was getting a commission to develop a screen.
