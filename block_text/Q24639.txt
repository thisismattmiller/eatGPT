When Pontus first came to New York in 1959, I had a car and took him around to visit  artists. Pontus knew Sam Francis from Paris and we soon met his neighbor on 23rd  Street, the painter Alfred Leslie, who had just made the film Pull My Daisy with Robert  Frank. Leslie’s enthusiasm helped spark Pontus’ interest in contemporary American art as  did Dorothy Miller’s exhibition Sixteen Americans at the Museum of Modern Art.  Moderna Museet’s first exhibition devoted to contemporary American art opened on  March 17, 1962. Pontus chose Alfred Leslie and three artists who had been in the Art in  Motion show: Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Richard Stankeiwicz. The show  was accompanied by programs of independent films from the New American Cinema.  Pontus again put me to work as Moderna Museet’s New York agent; and I collected and  shipped films and works for the exhibition, becoming friendly with the shippers W.R.  Keating and Budworth. I encouraged Pontus to buy works by the young New York  artists. Shown here to the left on the floor is Rauschenberg’s Monogram, which Pontus  did buy for the museum.
