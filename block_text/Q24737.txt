The sloping floor and ceiling of the Clam Room was designed by Robert Whitman to  provide a transition between the outside of the Pavilion and the Mirror Dome upstairs. It was dark, with some light coming from the glass ceiling which was the center part of the floor of the Mirror Dome. A sound-activated laser deflection system showered the floor and visitors with moving patterns of laser light 10 feet across. Lowell Cross designed the system which split the beam from a krypton laser into four colors, and sent each color beam to sets of mirrors mounted at right angles and vibrating up to 500 cycles per second  to create the patterns. This is a view of the Clam Room looking toward the entrance  tunnel.
