Martin: I think the collaboration was more you’d talk together, decide what you wanted to do and then the engineer would go off and build something they had talked about. I mean, I know that Robby Robinson talks about, in the article that Billy wrote about Solstice, that Bob said, “I want this, I have a certain idea.” And then Robby remembered the doors at Amsterdam airport and suggested that. They suggested things, suggested how to carry out Bob’s initial ideas. But once it was about building it, once they decided on it, then maybe the engineer would build something to a certain point and then come back to Bob. But I don’t think Bob was there soldering, for example. But of course, later, when he was making his prints he was very hands- on. Again, you’d have to talk to people who worked with him because I really didn’t. But I think with the engineering, Bob very much let the engineer do their part and then he would see it. And Billy always wanted to check with Bob, “Is this all right?” Particularly when the time for restorations or renovations came. You know, Per Biorn would build something and then he or Billy would make sure it was all right. Or, “How do you want it?”
