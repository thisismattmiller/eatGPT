The spherical mirror in the Pepsi Pavilion, showing the real image of the floor and the visitors hanging upside down in space over their heads. This optical effect resembles that of a hologram. Because of the size of our mirror, a spectator looking at the real image of a person could walk around that image and see it from all sides. The effect was  spectacular.  
 Our architect John Pearce devised an ingenious way the mylar mirror could be held up inside an air-tight spherical cage. A slight vacuum of less than 1/1000 of an atmosphere in the space between the cage and the mirror was sufficient to hold up the mirror. There was no need for cumbersome air locks.  
 The floor was divided into 10 areas made up of different materials, such as astroturf, rough wood, slate, tile, and asphalt. Through handsets, visitors could hear different sounds while standing on each different floor material: on the tile floor, horses hooves and shattering glass; on the astroturf, ducks, frogs, cicadas and lions roaring. These sounds were transmitted to the handset from wire loops embedded in the floor section.
