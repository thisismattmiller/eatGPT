Q: One other question about this early period and that’s the other side of Billy’s life, which is the engineering side. We talked about this the other day when we were talking but I wanted to get you on tape here talking about it. How did this go down with Bell? So here’s an engineer who is supposedly working. What was their reaction to someone who got very involved in the art world? We were talking about the number of hours the engineers were spending on 9 Evenings. How did that work in terms of their day jobs?
