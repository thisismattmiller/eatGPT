Martin: No. No. But someone like Per Biorn loved working with artists every chance he got. Later in the eighties and nineties, he was instrumental in renovating Rauschenberg’s pieces that incorporated technology, Dry Cell [1963], Oracle, Soundings. He worked with Bob R. and worked with other artists but his life was in engineering and his engineering job. You really didn’t have to understand the art, either. That was the other thing. The artist’s request was seen as an engineering problem to work on. At E.A.T. there wasn’t any idea of one artist being better than another. There was no aesthetic criteria for “the best artist got the best engineer” or anything like that. Anybody that called up, you tried to match them with somebody whose expertise fitted what they needed.
