Martin: Yes, I was. But for how I got there I need to go back in time to winter 1965. Bob Whitman did Prune Flat in December of ’65 at a benefit for Jonas Mekas’s Film-Makers’ Cinematheque. It was on Forty-first Street in some basement theater. He remembers it was the Wurlitzer Building with a theater space in the basement on West Forty-first. Whitman says that it was John Brockman, who was trying to do fundraising for Jonas Mekas and the fledgling Film- Makers’ Cinematheque. He went to Whitman and said, “Claes and Bob Rauschenberg are doing it. Will you join?” Then he went to Rauschenberg and said, “Whitman and Oldenburg are doing something.” [Laughter] He sort of got them all to say yes.
