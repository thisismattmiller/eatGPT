Martin: He says that he may have met Tinguely in Paris. Billy graduated from Kungliga Tekniska högskolan in Stockholm and then he spent a year as a technical assistant, stagiaire, with Thomson-Houston [Electric Company] in Paris. 1952–53 he spent in Paris. Pontus may have come to Paris during that period. Tinguely was part of the group at the Denise René gallery [Paris]. I think Pontus knew Tinguely or got to know Tinguely. Billy says he met Tinguely and Pontus introduced him in Paris as the “man who made anti-television sets.” It might not have been that year but, somehow—because Pontus worked to do the show, Le Mouvement, in ’55 with Denise René. Also it was during this time that Pontus invited Tinguely to Sweden. It was Pontus who wrote Billy in late 1959 and said, “Tinguely’s coming to New York. He has a project. Could you help him?”
