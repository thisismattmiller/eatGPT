 The Festival will be covered thoroughly by the press. LIFE, ESQUIRE, and other national magazines have planned feature stories. Naturally the specialized magazines in the fields of art, dance, music, science and engineering will give very heavy before and after coverage. In addition, a new environmental publication called BROADSIDE, published by Marion Javits and Clay Felker, will devote its entire first issue to the Festival.
 While there has been a great deal of interest expressed by the networks and local stations in doing television programs on the Festival, we have kept the television rights free. We would be happy to make whatever arrangements you would find most suitable for television coverage of the Festival.
 We anticipate a paid audience of 15,000 at a minimum. However, even with capacity business, the Festival would not be a "commercial" venture. Any profits would go towards a new foundation to further the creative collaboration of artists and scientists.  
 I will be doing a poster for the Festival which would of course be available to Xerox for its advertising and promotion purposes. In addition, we would be delighted to have Xerox machines print the programs for the audience as they enter the Armory. The artists and scientists are all open to any other ideas and suggestions for the participation of Xerox in this project. 
 As LIFE magazine says in its current issue, "the Festival, which Will take place in the same Armory as the 1913 Armory Show, may go down in art history as another landmark". In our opinion, LIFE is too cautious. The Festival will be a unique avant-garde event. As a pioneering effort, it should create great excitement and reward its sponsor with important publicity and prestige.
 I hope that you will share our enthusiasm and give us your financial support.  Since we are pressed by time, I would appreciate your reactions as soon as possible. 
 With thanks in advance.
 Sincerely, Robert Rauschenberg
