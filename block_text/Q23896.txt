GIANT MODEL AIRPLANES a benefit exhibition for EAT You are cordially invited to a non-profit exhibition and auction of GIANT MODEL AIRPLANES for the benefit of EXPERIMENTS IN ART AND TECHNOLOGY, INC., at the studio of ROBERT RAUSCHENBERG, 381 Lafayette Street, New York, New York, June 6-8, 1967. The exhibition consists of precisely scaled and detailed enlargements of stick-and-tissue-type models of vintage aircraft including two S.E. 5A SCOUT BIPLANES and a FOKKER DR-1 TRIPLANE--the type made famous by Baron Manfred Von Richthofen during World War I. MR. CHARLES ALLSOPP, the famous fine art auctioneer of CHRISTIE'S OF LONDON will conduct the auction beginning at 10:00 P.M. sharp on Thursday, June 8. The giant models were conceived and built by GEORGE MANUPELLI and JOSEPH WEHRER. Both are professors at The University of Michigan and active in the experimental music-theatre activities of the ONCE Group. Dr. Manupelli is also Director of the ANN ARBOR FILM FESTIVAL. The models are two-thirds actual size with wing spans of nearly 18 feet. They are made of pine, uncovered, and designed as outdoor sculpture that weather gradually and gracefully with time. Each is manned by a plastic pilot and has a movable propeller powered by a giant rubber band. Individual parts are numbered, while major sections easily disassemble for shipping or storage. Other artists who worked on the project are WILLIAM FINNERAN, who produced the cowl and propeller assemblies; DAVID HAXTON, who painted the huge facsimile of the box in which the original model kits are sold; MARY ASHLEY, who produced the giant simulated model plans; NICHOLAS BERTONI, who was the project engineer; and CHRISTOPHER FRAYNE, KATHLEEN YOUNG, CYNTHIA LIDDELL, and ANNE WEHRER. The group is known as the PLASTER OF PARIS AIRCRAFT CORP., D. DeVarti, Prop. EAT, Inc. is a non-profit tax-exempt foundation to promote direct collaboration between artists and technologists with the cooperation of industry.
