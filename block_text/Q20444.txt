Q: So the origin of one part of 9 Evenings. One thing that occurs to me is, do you think that the presence of dancers—so many of the choreographers and performers crucial to what becomes the Judson scene in the early sixties are so close to this group of visual artists, of sculptors, and painters. Do you think that had a serious impact? And Simone—it’s partly that some people are together but partly that you have movement artists working so closely with visual artists. I was trying to think of an equivalent. I think of things like [Igor] Stravinsky’s Ballets Russes.
