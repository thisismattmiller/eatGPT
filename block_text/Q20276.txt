Martin: Well, I have to say that that was something that Billy felt very strongly about. If you’re an engineer, you spent your life learning to be an engineer. You haven’t spent your life learning to be an artist. If you’re an artist, the same thing. Why should an artist have to spend time learning engineering, you know? It was a respect for the professionalism of each of them. It was a real respect for the fact that an artist is an artist. He or she has skills, has abilities, has instincts that are worth preserving. Not preserving—worth regarding. The engineer too comes with his own professionalism. But the collaboration wasn’t just, go off and make it and put them together. There was a conversation there. In Oracle—I mean, certain decisions Bob would make, like choosing small speakers and where he’d put them in each sculpture. He kind of knew. I’m sure that there was talking about it or, “How does this work?” Billy remembers asking Bob, “What do you want the knobs on the top of the staircase to look like?” He could kind of understand certain things. You’re participating if you’re asking. Asking the question means you’ve thought of it and you’re—do you know what I mean? You’re part of the process. So in a way, you become part of the process. You’re just not part of the art-making, the art decision-making process.
