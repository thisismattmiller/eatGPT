Again to stimulate interest in the technical community, E.A.T., in November 1967, announced a competition for the best contribution by an engineer to a work of art made in  collaboration with an artist. The prize was to be given to the engineer, and the judges  were all engineers.  
 Some of the works were to be selected by Pontus Hulten for his exhibition, “The  Machine,” at the Museum of Modern Art in 1968. E.A.T. offered to find partners for all engineers and artists who wanted to enter the competition.
