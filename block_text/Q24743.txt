This photograph is printed upside down to demonstrate the real-image effect in the mirror. We can clearly see the real image of the backs of two men (one wearing a white hat); and the fronts of the same two men standing on the floor, their arms raised, pointing toward their images. Visitors became very excited when they recognized themselves and  their friends in the mirror.
