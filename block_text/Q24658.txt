In Carriage Discreteness Yvonne Rainer spread out on the Armory floor slats, slabs,  cubes, planks, sheets of different materials like Masonite, wood, and styrofoam beams  made by Carl Andre. From a small balcony high on one wall of the Armory, Rainer  transmitted instructions to the performers, wearing receivers on their wrists, telling them  to carry objects from one part of the floor to another.  
 Rainer also had preprogrammed events, which were set in motion when her piece began.  They included film and slide projections, a super ball being dropped the the ceiling, a  garbage can releasing pieces of foam rubber over the area, and a lighted lucite rod  travelling high over the performance area. An excerpt of a film with W.C Fields juggling  bricks was shown on a screen that collapsed.  
 At the end of the piece, Steve Paxton launched himself from the balcony on a swing  attached to the ceiling, swinging back and forth until he came to a complete halt.
