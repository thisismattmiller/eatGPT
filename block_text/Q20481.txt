Martin: Yes. The first thing they did was to get an office. They rented a loft on the sixth floor of a building at 9 East Sixteenth Street. It was 5,000 square feet, so it was really huge. So they built a small space in the front southwest corner, toward the front windows, and that was the administrative office. And then they put a wall maybe a third of the way up from the back windows with a fairly large opening and back there was the technical part. Ralph Flynn, who had been a TA at Bell Labs, came to work full-time for E.A.T. as their technical director, helping artists with loans of equipment and with simple technical problems. Carolee Schneemann borrowed some for her piece Snows. Max Neuhaus was there, I know. So they lent stuff to different people. Then the middle space was left open as a meeting room. We began to have open houses on Sunday so artists and engineers could come together and talk. Just meet and begin to talk. Then we organized a series of lectures for artists on technology in the main space. So that was it. That was the office up until 1969, when we moved the administrative offices to 235 Park Avenue South when we took on the Pepsi Pavilion project. We still kept the loft on Sixteenth Street and some of the equipment for the Pavilion was designed and built there.
