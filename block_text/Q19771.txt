This piece is a dance with a set. It is cast not only by those chosen as permanent population (for the duration of the piece) but by those who have chosen to come to see it, and it is presumed that they will observe each other. With regards to air pressure and topography this piece is not an airplane, is pretty much the opposite of an airplane, but much of the rest of it is analogous.
