Martin: Yes, that’s what I mean about challenging himself. By choosing new art technologies or bringing new technologies into art, like he did with Don Saff, and printing with hot wax for some of the later ROCI pieces. [Note: Wax Fire Works series, part of ROCI USA, 1990–91] The later pieces that he worked on used unusual substrates—aluminum, copper, then polycarbonates. If you work with something you’ve never worked with before, you can’t predict how it will behave. The process is always new because you don’t know everything about the material. You are, as Bob would say, “collaborating” with it. It can still surprise you. If he had stuck with, say, drawings that were made by transfer rubbing, he would come to know it so well that he would always know how it would react. I didn’t mean he wouldn’t do incredible things. It wouldn’t have been a process into the unknown. The process wouldn’t have led him to unknown outcomes. So he was continually changing his medium and his tools, pushing into his own unknown.
