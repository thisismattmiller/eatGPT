"MAN AND HIS WORLD" COMPUTER FILM 
 
 "MAN AND HIS WORLD" IS A 50 SECOND COMPUTER-PRODUCED FILM MADE BY PROGRAMMING IN THE BEFLIX LANGUAGE*. THE PROGRAM WAS RUN ON AN IBM 7094 COMPUTER, WHOSE OUTPUT WAS THEN FED, VIA MAGNETIC TAPE, TO THE STROMBERG- CARLSON 4020 MICROFILM PRINTER WHICH ACTUALLY EXPOSED THE 35 MM FILM. EACH FRAME IS ACTUALLY A 252 x 184 RECTAN- GULAR ARRAY OF TINY ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS PRODUCED BY THE 4020's CHARACTRON TUBE. THE ORIGINAL FILM WAS BLACK AND WHITE; SOUND AND COLOR EFFECTS WERE ADDED BY NORMAL METHODS IN A MOVIE LAB. KEN KNOWLTON DEVELOPED THE SPECIAL SET OF SUBROU- TINES -- ESSENTIALLY AN EXTENSION TO THE BASIC BEFLIX LANGUAGE TO FACILITATE THE PRODUCTION OF THE MANY VISUAL EFFECTS: KALEIDOSCOPIC PATTERNS, FRINGER, AND SPECIAL ZOOMS, DISSOLVES AND LETTER FONTS. STAN VANDERBEEK THEN PRODUCED THE FILM BY WRITING ABOUT 100 LINES OF PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THESE SUBROUTINES.
