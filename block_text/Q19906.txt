Martin: My thesis was more a philosophy thesis than a political science one. The subject was economism, China and Russia and the theory of economism. You know, always in Marxist theory there’s this dichotomy between the socialist revolution that is coming inevitably as the capitalist economy develops and the workers become more and more impoverished and finally rise up⎯ make the revolution⎯and establish the new socialist order versus the idea that the workers must fight and struggle to overthrow [the] capitalist political system and build the new socialist economic and political order. [Vladimir] Lenin very strongly came down on the second side. In his famous political tract, What Is to Be Done? [1902], some of his socialist party colleagues who disagreed with him argued that he turned Marxism on its head. He saw Russia was still almost a feudal country and said, “No, we can’t wait for some vague historical inevitability. We have to take political power and use the political power to build the socialist economic order under it.” So there’s always this tension in Marxist theory and practice.
 [Joseph] Stalin died in 1953 and by 1956, Khrushchev was beginning to criticize the excessive repressive policies of Stalin and to become more “let’s build the economy now” and put some more emphasis on giving the people more consumer goods and economic incentives. Mao [Zedong] and Chinese Communist Party had just seized power in 1949 and were at the ideological stage of using their newly won political power to shape the society. So the fights between the Russians and the Chinese, ideologically, were the use of political power to build the economy and make the social changes, or focus less on political power (and repression) but build the economy as the path toward a socialist society. So that’s what I wrote about.
