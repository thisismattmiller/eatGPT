DEAR TED, I SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS SOME TIME AGO, BUT SENTIMENTS GOT IN THE WAY. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT MY RESIGNATION IS ESSENTIAL AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF E.A.T. I AM LESS AND LESS IN THE CITY, I AM WORKING THRU THE SPRING IN TAMPA, EXHIBITING IN PARIS AND AFRICA THIS SUMMER. BILLY NEEDS SOMEONE ON THE SPOT TO COUNCIL AND WORK. THE JOB IS TO GREAT AND TO IMPORTANT TO BE HELD BY SOMEONE WHO IS NOT ABLE TO WORK CLOSER WITH THE STAFF AND ITS NEEDS. I WILL REMAIN A REALISTIC SUPPORTER, AND OF COURSE ALWAYS INTERESTED AND COOPERATIVE IN YOUR PROJECTS. I WILL CONTACT JIM ANDERSON ABOUT THE HIGHWAY PROJECT THE FIRST OF NEXT WEEK.
 
 [TED I AM CERTAIN THIS IS THE DIFFICULT BUT CORRECT THING TO DO]
 
 AS ALWAYS YOUR FRIEND AND FAN
