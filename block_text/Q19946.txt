Martin: He would blow into each tube. This would dislodge the little piece of Kleenex and the powder would come out in a cloud of color. This is what I did. As I said, we performed the two pieces each weekend.
 That was the same summer that Christophe de Menil did Midsummer in August, where she invited artists to perform at different places near her home in the Hamptons [New York]. I remember she invited Twyla Tharp and dancers and showed Tony Conradâ€™s recently completed film, The Flicker [1965]. Bob Whitman did a piece called Two Holes of Water [1966]. I worked on that. I helped him with that. He asked me to find 16-millimeter films for him. One image he specifically asked for was penguins. My great triumph was to find a film on penguins that he wanted. A lot of documentaries made for schools were being de-accessioned for some reason. There was a place on Fifty-seventh Street where you could buy 16-millimeter films for not very much.
