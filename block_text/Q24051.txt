 Dear Mr. Wilson:
 As discussed with John Powers, I am writing to solicit financial support for the 1955 Festival of Theater and Engineering.
 The Festival was conceived as an exposition of the creative possibilities inherent in the interaction of art and science. Ten artists concerned with using technology as material for art have been working closely with about 30 scientists and engineers, under the leadership of Billy Kluver, since last January. The artists suggested problems and ideas for performance situations; the engineers designed and built very advanced technical equipment which in turn stimulated new ideas for the artists. The ten artists working on the project are:
 Lucinda Childs choreographer, dancer
 John Cage Composer, writer
 Oyvind Fahlstrom  painter, poet
 Alex Hay  painter, choreographer
 Deborah Hay choreographer, dancer 
 Claes Oldenburg painter, happening-author
 Steve Paxton  choreographer, dancer
 Robert Whitman sculptor, happening-author
 David Tudor  musician
 Robert Rauschenberg painter, choreographer
 All the artists have exhibited or performed their works in the past and all are artists of great reputation and daring.
 The Festival vill take place at the Armory at Lexington Avenue and 25th Street, from October 12 - 23, 1966. The budget is $50,000, covering the cost of designing and building the equipment, production costs, rental of the Armory, lighting and staging expenses, insurance, fees and the like.
 We have raised approximately $12,000 from individual contributions. Supporting us are Robert Scull, Virginia Kondratief, Seymour Schweber, Leo Castelli, Walter Gutman and others. In view of their conservative stockholder and current government problems, Bell Laboratories is supporting the project by contributing laboratory facilities as well as its top engineers and scientists.
