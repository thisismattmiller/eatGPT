SYNTHETIC SPEECH {Synthetic Speech}
 
 DEBBY'S INTENTIONS, AS I UNDERSTOOD THEM, WERE TO PRODUCE A MECHANICAL DIALOGUE OF THE TRIVIAL EXCHANGES THAT SOMETIMES OCCUR BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE WHO MEET ON THE STREET WITH NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT, BUT NOT THE SENSE TO PART WITHOUT CONVERSING. I USED A SPEECH SYNTHESIZER THAT PETE CUMMISKEY AND I DESIGNED FOR OUR WORK AND A COMPUTER PROGRAM WRITTEN BY FRED COOPER. 
 
 SINCE FRED'S PROGRAM WAS A SHORT SUMMER PROJECT, IT WAS MISSING A NUMBER OF BASIC SPEECH SOUNDS (PHONEMES) AND DID NOT HAVE MEANS OF PROVIDING AUTOMATICALLY TIMING AND INTONATION NECESSARY FOR PROPER STRESS PATTERNS. THESE HAD TO BE SUPPLIED BY HAND FROM KNOBS THAT COULD BE READ BY THE COMPUTER AND USED TO MODIFY PARAMETERS AS ONE LISTENED TO REPETITIONS OF THE SYNTHESIZED SPEECH. THESE RESTRICTIONS, AND OUR NEED TO FINISH THE PROJECT IN A REASON- ABLE TIME PROVIDED NATURAL CONSTRAINTS TO PRODUCE THE KIND OF STILTED MECHANICAL SPEECH DEBBY WANTED.
